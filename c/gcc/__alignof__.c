/*
 *	6.35 Inquiring on Alignment of Types or Variables
 *	The keyword __alignof__ allows you to inquire about how an object is aligned, or the
 *	minimum alignment usually required by a type. Its syntax is just like sizeof.
 *	For example, if the target machine requires a double value to be aligned on an 8-byte
 *	boundary, then __alignof__ (double) is 8. This is true on many RISC machines. On
 *	more traditional machine designs, __alignof__ (double) is 4 or even 2.
 *	Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference to any data type
 *	even at an odd address. For these machines, __alignof__ reports the smallest alignment
 *	that GCC will give the data type, usually as mandated by the target ABI.
 *	If the operand of __alignof__ is an lvalue rather than a type, its value is the required
 *	alignment for its type, taking into account any minimum alignment specifed with GCC’s
 *	__attribute__ extension (see Section 6.36 [Variable Attributes], page 329). For example,
 *	after this declaration:
 *	struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;
 *	the value of __alignof__ (foo1.y) is 1, even though its actual alignment is probably 2 or
 *	4, the same as __alignof__ (int).
 *	It is an error to ask for the alignment of an incomplete type.
