MEMCMP(3)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  MEMCMP(3)



NAME
       memcmp - compare memory areas

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  memcmp() function compares the first n bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the memory areas
       s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The memcmp() function returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first  n  bytes
       of s1 is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first n bytes of s2.

       For  a  nonzero return value, the sign is determined by the sign of the difference between the first pair
       of bytes (interpreted as unsigned char) that differ in s1 and s2.
