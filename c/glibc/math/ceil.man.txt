CEIL(3)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    CEIL(3)



NAME
       ceil, ceilf, ceill - ceiling function: smallest integral value not less than argument

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double ceil(double x);
       float ceilf(float x);
       long double ceill(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ceilf(), ceill():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return the smallest integral value that is not less than x.

       For example, ceil(0.5) is 1.0, and ceil(-0.5) is 0.0.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return the ceiling of x.

       If x is integral, +0, -0, NaN, or infinite, x itself is returned.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.  POSIX.1-2001 documents a range error for overflows, but see NOTES.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The ceil(), ceilf(), and ceill() functions are thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.

NOTES
       SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001 contain text about overflow (which might set errno to ERANGE, or raise an FE_OVER‐
       FLOW exception).  In practice, the result cannot overflow on any current machine, so this  error-handling
       stuff is just nonsense.  (More precisely, overflow can happen only when the maximum value of the exponent
       is smaller than the number of mantissa bits.  For the IEEE-754 standard 32-bit and 64-bit  floating-point
       numbers the maximum value of the exponent is 128 (respectively, 1024), and the number of mantissa bits is
       24 (respectively, 53).)

       The integral value returned by these functions may be too large to store in an integer type  (int,  long,
       etc.).  To avoid an overflow, which will produce undefined results, an application should perform a range
       check on the returned value before assigning it to an integer type.
