//CLOCK_REALTIME
//      System-wide clock that measures real (i.e., wall-clock) time.  Setting this clock requires  appro‐
//      priate privileges.  This clock is affected by discontinuous jumps in the system time (e.g., if the
//      system administrator manually changes the clock), and by the incremental adjustments performed  by
//      adjtime(3) and NTP.
//
//CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE (since Linux 2.6.32; Linux-specific)
//      A  faster  but less precise version of CLOCK_REALTIME.  Use when you need very fast, but not fine-
//      grained timestamps.
//
//
//CLOCK_MONOTONIC
//      Clock that cannot be set and represents monotonic  time  since  some  unspecified  starting
//      point.   This clock is not affected by discontinuous jumps in the system time (e.g., if the
//      system administrator manually changes the  clock),  but  is  affected  by  the  incremental
//      adjustments performed by adjtime(3) and NTP.
//
//CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE (since Linux 2.6.32; Linux-specific)
//      A faster but less precise version of CLOCK_MONOTONIC.  Use when you need very fast, but not
//      fine-grained timestamps.
//
//CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW (since Linux 2.6.28; Linux-specific)
//      Similar to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw hardware-based time  that  is  not
//      subject to NTP adjustments or the incremental adjustments performed by adjtime(3).
//
//CLOCK_BOOTTIME (since Linux 2.6.39; Linux-specific)
//      Identical  to  CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  except  it  also includes any time that the system is sus‐
//      pended.  This allows applications to get a suspend-aware monotonic clock without having  to
//      deal  with  the complications of CLOCK_REALTIME, which may have discontinuities if the time
//      is changed using settimeofday(2).
//
//CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
//      High-resolution per-process timer from the CPU.
//
//CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
//      Thread-specific CPU-time clock.
