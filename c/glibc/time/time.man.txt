TIME(2)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    TIME(2)



NAME
       time - get time in seconds

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       time_t time(time_t *t);

DESCRIPTION
       time() returns the time as the number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).

       If t is non-NULL, the return value is also stored in the memory pointed to by t.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  the  value  of  time  in  seconds  since the Epoch is returned.  On error, ((time_t) -1) is
       returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT t points outside your accessible address space.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX does not specify any error conditions.

NOTES
       POSIX.1 defines seconds since the Epoch using a formula that approximates the number of seconds between a
       specified  time  and  the  Epoch.  This formula takes account of the facts that all years that are evenly
       divisible by 4 are leap years, but years that are evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years unless  they
       are  also  evenly divisible by 400, in which case they are leap years.  This value is not the same as the
       actual number of seconds between the time and the Epoch, because  of  leap  seconds  and  because  system
       clocks  are not required to be synchronized to a standard reference.  The intention is that the interpre‐
       tation of seconds since the Epoch values be consistent; see POSIX.1-2008  Rationale  A.4.15  for  further
       rationale.
