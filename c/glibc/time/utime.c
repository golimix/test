/*	int utime (const char *filename, const struct utimbuf *times) [Function]
 *	This function is used to modify the fle times associated with the fle named flename.
 *	If times is a null pointer, then the access and modifcation times of the fle are set to
 *	the current time. Otherwise, they are set to the values from the actime and modtime
 *	members (respectively) of the utimbuf structure pointed to by times.
 *	The attribute modifcation time for the fle is set to the current time in either case
 *	(since changing the time stamps is itself a modifcation of the fle attributes).
 *	The utime function returns 0 if successful and -1 on failure. In addition to the usual
 *	fle name errors (see Section 11.2.3 [File Name Errors], page 224), the following errno
 *	error conditions are defned for this function:
 *	EACCES There is a permission problem in the case where a null pointer was passed
 *	as the times argument. In order to update the time stamp on the fle,
 *	you must either be the owner of the fle, have write permission for the
 *	fle, or be a privileged user.
 *	ENOENT The fle doesn’t exist.
 *	EPERM If the times argument is not a null pointer, you must either be the owner
 *	of the fle or be a privileged user.
 *	EROFS The fle lives on a read-only fle system.
