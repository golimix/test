NAME
       clock_getres, clock_gettime, clock_settime - clock and time functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       int clock_getres(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec *res);

       int clock_gettime(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec *tp);

       int clock_settime(clockid_t clk_id, const struct timespec *tp);

       Link with -lrt (only for glibc versions before 2.17).

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       clock_getres(), clock_gettime(), clock_settime():
              _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 199309L

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  clock_getres() finds the resolution (precision) of the specified clock clk_id, and, if res
       is non-NULL, stores it in the struct timespec pointed to by res.  The resolution of clocks depends on the
       implementation  and  cannot  be  configured by a particular process.  If the time value pointed to by the
       argument tp of clock_settime() is not a multiple of res, then it is truncated to a multiple of res.

       The functions clock_gettime() and clock_settime() retrieve and  set  the  time  of  the  specified  clock
       clk_id.

       The res and tp arguments are timespec structures, as specified in <time.h>:

           struct timespec {
               time_t   tv_sec;        /* seconds */
               long     tv_nsec;       /* nanoseconds */
           };

       The  clk_id  argument  is the identifier of the particular clock on which to act.  A clock may be system-
       wide and hence visible for all processes, or per-process  if  it  measures  time  only  within  a  single
       process.

       All  implementations support the system-wide real-time clock, which is identified by CLOCK_REALTIME.  Its
       time represents seconds and nanoseconds since the Epoch.  When its time is changed, timers for a relative
       interval are unaffected, but timers for an absolute point in time are affected.

       More  clocks  may  be implemented.  The interpretation of the corresponding time values and the effect on
       timers is unspecified.

       Sufficiently recent versions of glibc and the Linux kernel support the following clocks:

       CLOCK_REALTIME
              System-wide clock that measures real (i.e., wall-clock) time.  Setting this clock requires  appro‐
              priate privileges.  This clock is affected by discontinuous jumps in the system time (e.g., if the
              system administrator manually changes the clock), and by the incremental adjustments performed  by
              adjtime(3) and NTP.

       CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE (since Linux 2.6.32; Linux-specific)
              A  faster  but less precise version of CLOCK_REALTIME.  Use when you need very fast, but not fine-
              grained timestamps.


       CLOCK_MONOTONIC
              Clock that cannot be set and represents monotonic  time  since  some  unspecified  starting
              point.   This clock is not affected by discontinuous jumps in the system time (e.g., if the
              system administrator manually changes the  clock),  but  is  affected  by  the  incremental
              adjustments performed by adjtime(3) and NTP.

       CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE (since Linux 2.6.32; Linux-specific)
              A faster but less precise version of CLOCK_MONOTONIC.  Use when you need very fast, but not
              fine-grained timestamps.

       CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW (since Linux 2.6.28; Linux-specific)
              Similar to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw hardware-based time  that  is  not
              subject to NTP adjustments or the incremental adjustments performed by adjtime(3).

       CLOCK_BOOTTIME (since Linux 2.6.39; Linux-specific)
              Identical  to  CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  except  it  also includes any time that the system is sus‐
              pended.  This allows applications to get a suspend-aware monotonic clock without having  to
              deal  with  the complications of CLOCK_REALTIME, which may have discontinuities if the time
              is changed using settimeofday(2).

       CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
              High-resolution per-process timer from the CPU.

       CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
              Thread-specific CPU-time clock.

RETURN VALUE
       clock_gettime(), clock_settime() and clock_getres() return 0 for success, or -1  for  failure  (in
       which case errno is set appropriately).

ERRORS
       EFAULT tp points outside the accessible address space.

       EINVAL The clk_id specified is not supported on this system.

       EPERM  clock_settime() does not have permission to set the clock indicated.

CONFORMING TO
       SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.

AVAILABILITY
       On  POSIX  systems  on which these functions are available, the symbol _POSIX_TIMERS is defined in
       <unistd.h> to a  value  greater  than  0.   The  symbols  _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK,  _POSIX_CPUTIME,
       _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME      indicate      that      CLOCK_MONOTONIC,      CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID,
       CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID are available.  (See also sysconf(3).)

NOTES
   Note for SMP systems
       The CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks are  realized  on  many  platforms
       using  timers  from the CPUs (TSC on i386, AR.ITC on Itanium).  These registers may differ between
       CPUs and as a consequence these clocks may return bogus  results  if  a  process  is  migrated  to
       another CPU.

       If  the CPUs in an SMP system have different clock sources then there is no way to maintain a cor‐
       relation between the timer registers since each CPU will run at a  slightly  different  frequency.
       If that is the case then clock_getcpuclockid(0) will return ENOENT to signify this condition.  The
       two clocks will then be useful only if it can be ensured that a process stays on a certain CPU.

       The processors in an SMP system do not start all at exactly the same time and therefore the  timer
       registers  are  typically  running at an offset.  Some architectures include code that attempts to
       limit these offsets on bootup.  However, the code cannot guarantee to accurately tune the offsets.
       Glibc  contains  no  provisions  to  deal with these offsets (unlike the Linux Kernel).  Typically
       these offsets are small and therefore the effects may be negligible in most cases.

BUGS
       According   to   POSIX.1-2001,   a   process   with   "appropriate   privileges"   may   set   the
       CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID  and  CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID  clocks  using  clock_settime().  On Linux,
       these clocks are not settable (i.e., no process has "appropriate privileges").
