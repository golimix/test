FALLOCATE(2)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                               FALLOCATE(2)



NAME
       fallocate - manipulate(操作) file space

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <fcntl.h>

       int fallocate(int fd, int mode, off_t offset, off_t len);

DESCRIPTION
       This  is a nonportable, Linux-specific system call.  For the portable, POSIX.1-specified method of ensur‐
       ing that space is allocated for a file, see posix_fallocate(3).

       fallocate() allows the caller to directly manipulate the allocated disk space for the file referred to by
       fd for the byte range starting at offset and continuing for len bytes.

       The  mode argument determines the operation to be performed on the given range.  Details of the supported
       operations are given in the subsections below.

   Allocating disk space
       The default operation (i.e., mode is zero) of fallocate() allocates and  initializes  to  zero  the  disk
       space  within  the  range  specified  by  offset and len.  The file size (as reported by stat(2)) will be
       changed if offset+len is greater than the file size.  This default behavior closely resembles the  behav‐
       ior  of  the  posix_fallocate(3)  library function, and is intended as a method of optimally implementing
       that function.

       After a successful call, subsequent writes into the range specified by offset and len are guaranteed  not
       to fail because of lack of disk space.

       If  the  FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE flag is specified in mode, the behavior of the call is similar, but the file
       size will not be changed even if offset+len is greater than the file size.  Preallocating  zeroed  blocks
       beyond the end of the file in this manner is useful for optimizing append workloads.

       Because  allocation  is  done in block size chunks, fallocate() may allocate a larger range of disk space
       than was specified.

   Deallocating file space
       Specifying the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE flag (available since Linux 2.6.38) in mode deallocates space  (i.e.,
       creates  a hole) in the byte range starting at offset and continuing for len bytes.  Within the specified
       range, partial file system blocks are zeroed, and whole file system blocks are  removed  from  the  file.
       After a successful call, subsequent reads from this range will return zeroes.

       The  FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE  flag  must be ORed with FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE in mode; in other words, even when
       punching off the end of the file, the file size (as reported by stat(2)) does not change.

       Not all file systems support FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE; if a file system doesn't  support  the  operation,  an
       error is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, fallocate() returns zero.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor, or is not opened for writing.

       EFBIG  offset+len exceeds the maximum file size.

       EINTR  A signal was caught during execution.

       EINVAL offset was less than 0, or len was less than or equal to 0.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file system.

       ENODEV fd  does  not refer to a regular file or a directory.  (If fd is a pipe or FIFO, a different error
              results.)

       ENOSPC There is not enough space left on the device containing the file referred to by fd.

       ENOSYS This kernel does not implement fallocate().

       EOPNOTSUPP
              The file system containing the file referred to by fd does not support this operation; or the mode
              is not supported by the file system containing the file referred to by fd.

       EPERM  The  file  referred  to  by  fd  is  marked  immutable  (see  chattr(1)).  Or: mode specifies FAL‐
              LOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE and the file referred to by fd is marked append-only (see chattr(1)).

       ESPIPE fd refers to a pipe or FIFO.

VERSIONS
       fallocate() is available on Linux since kernel 2.6.23.  Support is provided by glibc since version  2.10.
       The FALLOC_FL_* flags are defined in glibc headers only since version 2.18.

CONFORMING TO
       fallocate() is Linux-specific.
