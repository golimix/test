/*	13.12 Duplicating Descriptors
 *	You can duplicate a fle descriptor, or allocate another fle descriptor that refers to the same
 *	open fle as the original. Duplicate descriptors share one fle position and one set of fle
 *	status ﬂags (see Section 13.14 [File Status Flags], page 333), but each has its own set of fle
 *	descriptor ﬂags (see Section 13.13 [File Descriptor Flags], page 331).
 *	The major use of duplicating a fle descriptor is to implement redirection of input or
 *	output: that is, to change the fle or pipe that a particular fle descriptor corresponds to.
 *	You can perform this operation using the fcntl function with the F_DUPFD command,
 *	but there are also convenient functions dup and dup2 for duplicating descriptors.
 *	The fcntl function and ﬂags are declared in ‘fcntl.h’, while prototypes for dup and
 *	dup2 are in the header fle ‘unistd.h’.
 *	int dup (int old) [Function]
 *	This function copies descriptor old to the frst available descriptor number (the frst
 *	number not currently open). It is equivalent to fcntl (old, F_DUPFD, 0).
 *	int dup2 (int old, int new) [Function]
 *	This function copies the descriptor old to descriptor number new.
 *	If old is an invalid descriptor, then dup2 does nothing; it does not close new. Other
 *	wise, the new duplicate of old replaces any previous meaning of descriptor new, as if
 *	new were closed frst.
 *	If old and new are diﬀerent numbers, and old is a valid descriptor number, then dup2
 *	is equivalent to:
 *	close (new);
 *	fcntl (old, F_DUPFD, new)
 *	However, dup2 does this atomically; there is no instant in the middle of calling dup2
 *	at which new is closed and not yet a duplicate of old.
 *	int F_DUPFD [Macro]
 *	This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to copy the fle descriptor
 *	given as the frst argument.
 *	The form of the call in this case is:
 *	fcntl (old, F_DUPFD, next-filedes)
 *	The next-fledes argument is of type int and specifes that the fle descriptor returned
 *	should be the next available one greater than or equal to this value.
 *	The return value from fcntl with this command is normally the value of the new
 *	fle descriptor. A return value of −1 indicates an error. The following errno error
 *	conditions are defned for this command:
 *	EBADF The old argument is invalid.
 *	EINVAL The next-fledes argument is invalid.
 *	EMFILE There are no more fle descriptors available—your program is already
 *	using the maximum. In BSD and GNU, the maximum is controlled by a
 *	resource limit that can be changed; see Section 22.2 [Limiting Resource
 *	Usage], page 575, for more information about the RLIMIT_NOFILE limit.
 *	ENFILE is not a possible error code for dup2 because dup2 does not create a new
 *	opening of a fle; duplicate descriptors do not count toward the limit which ENFILE
 *	indicates. EMFILE is possible because it refers to the limit on distinct descriptor
 *	numbers in use in one process.
 *	Here is an example showing how to use dup2 to do redirection. Typically, redirection
 *	of the standard streams (like stdin) is done by a shell or shell-like program before calling
 *	one of the exec functions (see Section 26.5 [Executing a File], page 691) to execute a new
 *	program in a child process. When the new program is executed, it creates and initializes
 *	the standard streams to point to the corresponding fle descriptors, before its main function
 *	is invoked.
 *	So, to redirect standard input to a fle, the shell could do something like:
 *	pid = fork ();
 *	if (pid == 0)
 *	{
 *	char *filename;
 *	char *program;
 *	int file;
 *	...
 *	file = TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (open (filename, O_RDONLY));
 *	dup2 (file, STDIN_FILENO);
 *	TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (close (file));
 *	execv (program, NULL);
 *	}
 *	There is also a more detailed example showing how to implement redirection in the
 *	context of a pipeline of processes in Section 27.6.3 [Launching Jobs], page 704.
