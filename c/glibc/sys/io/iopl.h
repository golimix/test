 * also allow the user space task to use the CLI/STI instructions.
 *
 * Disabling interrupts in a user space task is dangerous as it might lock
 * up the machine and the semantics vs. syscalls and exceptions is
 * undefined.
 *
 * Setting IOPL to level 0-2 is disabling I/O permissions. Level 3
 * 3 enables them.
 *
 * IOPL is strictly per thread and inherited on fork.
