PERSONALITY(2)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             PERSONALITY(2)



NAME
       personality - set the process execution domain

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/personality.h>

       int personality(unsigned long persona);

DESCRIPTION
       Linux supports different execution domains, or personalities, for each process.  Among other things, exe‐
       cution domains tell Linux how to map signal numbers into signal actions.   The  execution  domain  system
       allows Linux to provide limited support for binaries compiled under other UNIX-like operating systems.

       This  function  will return the current personality() when persona equals 0xffffffff.  Otherwise, it will
       make the execution domain referenced by persona the new execution domain of the calling process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the previous persona is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The kernel was unable to change the personality.

CONFORMING TO
       personality() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.
