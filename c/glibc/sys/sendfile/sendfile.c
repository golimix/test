 *	The sendfile system call provides an efficient mechanism for copying data from one file
 *	descriptor to another. The file descriptors may be open to disk files, sockets, or other devices.
 *	Typically, to copy from one file descriptor to another, a program allocates a fixed-size buffer,
 *	copies some data from one descriptor into the buffer, writes the buffer out to the other descriptor,
 *	and repeats until all the data has been copied. This is inefficient in both time and space because it
 *	requires additional memory for the buffer and performs an extra copy of the data into that buffer.
 *	Using sendfile, the intermediate buffer can be eliminated. Call sendfile, passing the file
 *	descriptor to write to; the descriptor to read from; a pointer to an offset variable; and the number of
 *	bytes to transfer. The offset variable contains the offset in the input file from which the read should
 *	start (0 indicates the beginning of the file) and is updated to the position in the file after the transfer.
 *	The return value is the number of bytes transferred. Include <sys/sendfile.h> in your program if
 *	it uses sendfile.
 *	The program in Listing 8.10 is a simple but extremely efficient implementation of a file copy.
 *	When invoked with two filenames on the command line, it copies the contents of the first file into a
 *	file named by the second. It uses fstat to determine the size, in bytes, of the source file.
