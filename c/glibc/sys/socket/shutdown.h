/*
 *	16.8.1 Creating a Socket
 *	The primitive for creating a socket is the socket function, declared in ‘sys/socket.h’.
 *	int socket (int namespace, int style, int protocol) [Function]
 *	This function creates a socket and specifes communication style style, which should be
 *	one of the socket styles listed in Section 16.2 [Communication Styles], page 390. The
 *	namespace argument specifes the namespace; it must be PF_LOCAL (see Section 16.5
 *	[The Local Namespace], page 395) or PF_INET (see Section 16.6 [The Internet Names
 *	pace], page 397). protocol designates the specifc protocol (see Section 16.1 [Socket
 *	Concepts], page 389); zero is usually right for protocol.
 *	The return value from socket is the fle descriptor for the new socket, or -1 in case
 *	of error. The following errno error conditions are defned for this function:
 *	EPROTONOSUPPORT
 *	The protocol or style is not supported by the namespace specifed.
 *	EMFILE The process already has too many fle descriptors open.
 *	ENFILE The system already has too many fle descriptors open.
 *	EACCES The process does not have the privilege to create a socket of the specifed
 *	style or protocol.
 *	ENOBUFS The system ran out of internal buﬀer space.
 *	The fle descriptor returned by the socket function supports both read and write
 *	operations. However, like pipes, sockets do not support fle positioning operations.
 *
 *	16.8.2 Closing a Socket
 *	When you have fnished using a socket, you can simply close its fle descriptor with close;
 *	see Section 13.1 [Opening and Closing Files], page 296. If there is still data waiting to be
 *	transmitted over the connection, normally close tries to complete this transmission. You
 *	can control this behavior using the SO_LINGER socket option to specify a timeout period;
 *	see Section 16.12 [Socket Options], page 429.
 *	You can also shut down only reception or transmission on a connection by calling
 *	shutdown, which is declared in ‘sys/socket.h’.
 *	int shutdown (int socket, int how) [Function]
 *	The shutdown function shuts down the connection of socket socket. The argument
 *	how specifes what action to perform:
 *	0 Stop receiving data for this socket. If further data arrives, reject it.
 *	1 Stop trying to transmit data from this socket. Discard any data waiting
 *	to be sent. Stop looking for acknowledgement of data already sent; don’t
 *	retransmit it if it is lost.
 *	2 Stop both reception and transmission.
 *	The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure. The following errno error condi
 *	tions are defned for this function:
 *	EBADF socket is not a valid fle descriptor.
 *	ENOTSOCK socket is not a socket.
 *	ENOTCONN socket is not connected.
