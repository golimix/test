INOTIFY_ADD_WATCH(2)                        Linux Programmer's Manual                       INOTIFY_ADD_WATCH(2)



NAME
       inotify_add_watch - add a watch to an initialized inotify instance

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/inotify.h>

       int inotify_add_watch(int fd, const char *pathname, uint32_t mask);

DESCRIPTION
       inotify_add_watch() adds a new watch, or modifies an existing watch, for the file whose location is spec‐
       ified in pathname; the caller must have read permission for  this  file.   The  fd  argument  is  a  file
       descriptor  referring to the inotify instance whose watch list is to be modified.  The events to be moni‐
       tored for pathname are specified in the mask bit-mask argument.  See inotify(7) for a description of  the
       bits that can be set in mask.

       A successful call to inotify_add_watch() returns the unique watch descriptor associated with pathname for
       this inotify instance.  If pathname was not previously being watched by this inotify instance,  then  the
       watch  descriptor is newly allocated.  If pathname was already being watched, then the descriptor for the
       existing watch is returned.

       The watch descriptor is returned by later read(2)s from the inotify file descriptor.  These  reads  fetch
       inotify_event structures (see inotify(7)) indicating file system events; the watch descriptor inside this
       structure identifies the object for which the event occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, inotify_add_watch() returns a nonnegative watch descriptor.  On  error  -1  is  returned  and
       errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES Read access to the given file is not permitted.

       EBADF  The given file descriptor is not valid.

       EFAULT pathname points outside of the process's accessible address space.

       EINVAL The given event mask contains no valid events; or fd is not an inotify file descriptor.

       ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOSPC The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate
              a needed resource.

VERSIONS
       Inotify was merged into the 2.6.13 Linux kernel.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux-specific.
