NAME
       open, creat - open and possibly create a file or device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/stat.h>
       #include <fcntl.h>

       int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
       int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);

       int creat(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

DESCRIPTION
       Given  a  pathname  for a file, open() returns a file descriptor, a small, nonnegative integer for use in
       subsequent system calls (read(2), write(2), lseek(2), fcntl(2), etc.).  The file descriptor returned by a
       successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process.

       By  default, the new file descriptor is set to remain open across an execve(2) (i.e., the FD_CLOEXEC file
       descriptor flag described in fcntl(2) is initially disabled; the O_CLOEXEC flag, described below, can  be
       used to change this default).  The file offset is set to the beginning of the file (see lseek(2)).

       A  call  to  open() creates a new open file description, an entry in the system-wide table of open files.
       This entry records the file offset and the file status flags (modifiable via the fcntl(2) F_SETFL  opera‐
       tion).   A  file descriptor is a reference to one of these entries; this reference is unaffected if path‐
       name is subsequently removed or modified to refer to a different file.  The new open file description  is
       initially not shared with any other process, but sharing may arise via fork(2).

       The  argument flags must include one of the following access modes: O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR.  These
       request opening the file read-only, write-only, or read/write, respectively.

       In addition, zero or more file creation flags and file status flags can be bitwise-or'd  in  flags.   The
       file  creation  flags  are  O_CLOEXEC,  O_CREAT,  O_DIRECTORY, O_EXCL, O_NOCTTY, O_NOFOLLOW, O_TRUNC, and
       O_TTY_INIT.  The file status flags are all of the remaining flags listed below.  The distinction  between
       these  two  groups  of  flags is that the file status flags can be retrieved and (in some cases) modified
       using fcntl(2).  The full list of file creation flags and file status flags is as follows:

       O_APPEND
              The file is opened in append mode.  Before each write(2), the file offset is positioned at the end
              of  the  file,  as  if with lseek(2).  O_APPEND may lead to corrupted files on NFS file systems if
              more than one process appends data to a file at once.   This  is  because  NFS  does  not  support
              appending  to  a file, so the client kernel has to simulate it, which can't be done without a race
              condition.

       O_ASYNC
              Enable signal-driven I/O: generate a signal (SIGIO  by  default,  but  this  can  be  changed  via
              fcntl(2))  when  input or output becomes possible on this file descriptor.  This feature is avail‐
              able only for terminals, pseudoterminals, sockets, and (since Linux 2.6)  pipes  and  FIFOs.   See
              fcntl(2) for further details.

       O_CLOEXEC (Since Linux 2.6.23)
              Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new file descriptor.  Specifying this flag permits a program
              to avoid additional fcntl(2) F_SETFD operations to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag.  Additionally, use  of
              this  flag  is  essential  in  some multithreaded programs since using a separate fcntl(2) F_SETFD
              operation to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag does not suffice to avoid race conditions  where  one  thread
              opens a file descriptor at the same time as another thread does a fork(2) plus execve(2).

       O_CREAT
              If  the  file  does  not  exist it will be created.  The owner (user ID) of the file is set to the
              effective user ID of the process.  The group ownership (group ID) is set either to  the  effective
              group  ID of the process or to the group ID of the parent directory (depending on file system type
              and mount options, and the mode of the parent directory, see the mount options bsdgroups and sysv‐
              groups described in mount(8)).

              mode  specifies  the permissions to use in case a new file is created.  This argument must be sup‐
              plied when O_CREAT is specified in flags; if O_CREAT is not specified, then mode is ignored.   The
              effective permissions are modified by the process's umask in the usual way: The permissions of the
              created file are (mode & ~umask).  Note that this mode applies only  to  future  accesses  of  the
              newly  created  file;  the  open() call that creates a read-only file may well return a read/write
              file descriptor.

              The following symbolic constants are provided for mode:

              S_IRWXU  00700 user (file owner) has read, write and execute permission

              S_IRUSR  00400 user has read permission

              S_IWUSR  00200 user has write permission

              S_IXUSR  00100 user has execute permission

              S_IRWXG  00070 group has read, write and execute permission

              S_IRGRP  00040 group has read permission

              S_IWGRP  00020 group has write permission

              S_IXGRP  00010 group has execute permission

              S_IRWXO  00007 others have read, write and execute permission

              S_IROTH  00004 others have read permission

              S_IWOTH  00002 others have write permission

              S_IXOTH  00001 others have execute permission

       O_DIRECT (Since Linux 2.4.10)
              Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and from this file.  In general this will degrade per‐
              formance,  but it is useful in special situations, such as when applications do their own caching.
              File I/O is done directly to/from user-space buffers.  The O_DIRECT  flag  on  its  own  makes  an
              effort  to  transfer  data synchronously, but does not give the guarantees of the O_SYNC flag that
              data and necessary metadata are transferred.  To guarantee synchronous I/O, O_SYNC must be used in
              addition to O_DIRECT.  See NOTES below for further discussion.

              A semantically similar (but deprecated) interface for block devices is described in raw(8).

       O_DIRECTORY
              If  pathname  is  not  a  directory, cause the open to fail.  This flag is Linux-specific, and was
              added in kernel version 2.1.126, to avoid denial-of-service problems if opendir(3) is called on  a
              FIFO or tape device.

       O_EXCL Ensure that this call creates the file: if this flag is specified in conjunction with O_CREAT, and
              pathname already exists, then open() will fail.

              When these two flags are specified, symbolic links are not followed: if  pathname  is  a  symbolic
              link, then open() fails regardless of where the symbolic link points to.

              In  general,  the  behavior  of  O_EXCL  is undefined if it is used without O_CREAT.  There is one
              exception: on Linux 2.6 and later, O_EXCL can be used without O_CREAT  if  pathname  refers  to  a
              block  device.  If the block device is in use by the system (e.g., mounted), open() fails with the
              error EBUSY.

              On NFS, O_EXCL is supported only when using NFSv3 or later on kernel 2.6 or later.  In  NFS  envi‐
              ronments  where  O_EXCL  support  is not provided, programs that rely on it for performing locking
              tasks will contain a race condition.  Portable programs that want to perform atomic  file  locking
              using  a  lockfile, and need to avoid reliance on NFS support for O_EXCL, can create a unique file
              on the same file system (e.g., incorporating hostname and PID), and use link(2) to make a link  to
              the lockfile.  If link(2) returns 0, the lock is successful.  Otherwise, use stat(2) on the unique
              file to check if its link count has increased to 2, in which case the lock is also successful.

       O_LARGEFILE
              (LFS) Allow files whose sizes cannot be represented in an off_t (but  can  be  represented  in  an
              off64_t) to be opened.  The _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE macro must be defined (before including any header
              files) in order to obtain this definition.  Setting the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS feature test macro to 64
              (rather than using O_LARGEFILE) is the preferred method of accessing large files on 32-bit systems
              (see feature_test_macros(7)).

       O_NOATIME (Since Linux 2.6.8)
              Do not update the file last access time (st_atime in the inode) when the file  is  read(2).   This
              flag  is  intended  for use by indexing or backup programs, where its use can significantly reduce
              the amount of disk activity.  This flag may not be effective on all file systems.  One example  is
              NFS, where the server maintains the access time.

       O_NOCTTY
              If  pathname  refers  to a terminal device—see tty(4)—it will not become the process's controlling
              terminal even if the process does not have one.

       O_NOFOLLOW
              If pathname is a symbolic link, then the open fails.  This is a FreeBSD extension, which was added
              to  Linux  in version 2.1.126.  Symbolic links in earlier components of the pathname will still be
              followed.  See also O_NOPATH below.

       O_NONBLOCK or O_NDELAY
              When possible, the file is opened in nonblocking mode.  Neither  the  open()  nor  any  subsequent
              operations  on  the file descriptor which is returned will cause the calling process to wait.  For
              the handling of FIFOs (named pipes), see also fifo(7).  For a discussion of the effect  of  O_NON‐
              BLOCK in conjunction with mandatory file locks and with file leases, see fcntl(2).

       O_PATH (since Linux 2.6.39)
              Obtain  a  file  descriptor that can be used for two purposes: to indicate a location in the file-
              system tree and to perform operations that act purely at the  file  descriptor  level.   The  file
              itself  is  not  opened, and other file operations (e.g., read(2), write(2), fchmod(2), fchown(2),
              fgetxattr(2)) fail with the error EBADF.

              The following operations can be performed on the resulting file descriptor:

              *  close(2); fchdir(2) (since Linux 3.5); fstat(2) (since Linux 3.6).

              *  Duplicating the file descriptor (dup(2), fcntl(2) F_DUPFD, etc.).

              *  Getting and setting file descriptor flags (fcntl(2) F_GETFD and F_SETFD).

              *  Retrieving open file status flags using the fcntl(2) F_GETFL operation: the returned flags will
                 include the bit O_PATH.


              *  Passing  the  file  descriptor  as the dirfd argument of openat(2) and the other "*at()" system
                 calls.

              *  Passing the file descriptor to another process via a UNIX  domain  socket  (see  SCM_RIGHTS  in
                 unix(7)).

              When O_PATH is specified in flags, flag bits other than O_DIRECTORY and O_NOFOLLOW are ignored.

              If the O_NOFOLLOW flag is also specified, then the call returns a file descriptor referring to the
              symbolic link.  This file descriptor can be used as the dirfd argument in  calls  to  fchownat(2),
              fstatat(2),  linkat(2),  and readlinkat(2) with an empty pathname to have the calls operate on the
              symbolic link.

       O_SYNC The file is opened for synchronous I/O.  Any write(2)s on the resulting file descriptor will block
              the  calling  process  until the data has been physically written to the underlying hardware.  But
              see NOTES below.

       O_TRUNC
              If the file already exists and is a regular file and the open mode allows writing (i.e., is O_RDWR
              or O_WRONLY) it will be truncated to length 0.  If the file is a FIFO or terminal device file, the
              O_TRUNC flag is ignored.  Otherwise the effect of O_TRUNC is unspecified.

       Some of these optional flags can be altered using fcntl(2) after the file has been opened.

       creat() is equivalent to open() with flags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

RETURN VALUE
       open() and creat() return the new file descriptor, or -1 if an error occurred (in which  case,  errno  is
       set appropriately).

ERRORS
       EACCES The  requested  access  to  the file is not allowed, or search permission is denied for one of the
              directories in the path prefix of pathname, or the file did not exist yet and write access to  the
              parent directory is not allowed.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EDQUOT Where O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the user's quota of disk blocks or inodes
              on the file system has been exhausted.

       EEXIST pathname already exists and O_CREAT and O_EXCL were used.

       EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address space.

       EFBIG  See EOVERFLOW.

       EINTR  While blocked waiting to complete an open of a slow device (e.g., a FIFO; see fifo(7)),  the  call
              was interrupted by a signal handler; see signal(7).

       EISDIR pathname  refers  to  a  directory and the access requested involved writing (that is, O_WRONLY or
              O_RDWR is set).

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving pathname, or O_NOFOLLOW  was  specified  but
              pathname was a symbolic link.

       EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of files open.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              pathname was too long.

       ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENODEV pathname  refers  to  a  device special file and no corresponding device exists.  (This is a Linux
              kernel bug; in this situation ENXIO must be returned.)

       ENOENT O_CREAT is not set and the named file does not exist.  Or, a directory component in pathname  does
              not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOSPC pathname was to be created but the device containing pathname has no room for the new file.

       ENOTDIR
              A component used as a directory in pathname is not, in fact, a directory, or O_DIRECTORY was spec‐
              ified and pathname was not a directory.

       ENXIO  O_NONBLOCK | O_WRONLY is set, the named file is a FIFO and no process has the file open for  read‐
              ing.  Or, the file is a device special file and no corresponding device exists.

       EOVERFLOW
              pathname refers to a regular file that is too large to be opened.  The usual scenario here is that
              an application compiled on a 32-bit platform without -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 tried to open  a  file
              whose  size  exceeds  (2<<31)-1  bits; see also O_LARGEFILE above.  This is the error specified by
              POSIX.1-2001; in kernels before 2.6.24, Linux gave the error EFBIG for this case.

       EPERM  The O_NOATIME flag was specified, but the effective user ID of the caller did not match the  owner
              of the file and the caller was not privileged (CAP_FOWNER).

       EROFS  pathname refers to a file on a read-only file system and write access was requested.

       ETXTBSY
              pathname  refers  to  an  executable  image which is currently being executed and write access was
              requested.

       EWOULDBLOCK
              The O_NONBLOCK flag was specified, and an incompatible lease was held on the file (see fcntl(2)).

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  The O_DIRECTORY, O_NOATIME, O_NOFOLLOW, and O_PATH flags are Linux-specific,
       and one may need to define _GNU_SOURCE (before including any header files) to obtain their definitions.

       The O_CLOEXEC flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, but is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

       O_DIRECT  is not specified in POSIX; one has to define _GNU_SOURCE (before including any header files) to
       get its definition.

NOTES
       Under Linux, the O_NONBLOCK flag indicates that one wants to open  but  does  not  necessarily  have  the
       intention to read or write.  This is typically used to open devices in order to get a file descriptor for
       use with ioctl(2).

       Unlike the other values that can be specified in flags, the access mode values  O_RDONLY,  O_WRONLY,  and
       O_RDWR,  do  not  specify  individual bits.  Rather, they define the low order two bits of flags, and are
       defined respectively as 0, 1, and 2.  In other words, the combination O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY  is  a  logical
       error,  and  certainly does not have the same meaning as O_RDWR.  Linux reserves the special, nonstandard
       access mode 3 (binary 11) in flags to mean: check for read and write permission on the file and return  a
       descriptor that can't be used for reading or writing.  This nonstandard access mode is used by some Linux
       drivers to return a descriptor that is to be used only for device-specific ioctl(2) operations.

       The (undefined) effect of O_RDONLY | O_TRUNC varies among implementations.  On many systems the  file  is
       actually truncated.

       There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS, affecting amongst others O_SYNC and O_NDELAY.

       POSIX  provides  for  three  different  variants  of synchronized I/O, corresponding to the flags O_SYNC,
       O_DSYNC, and O_RSYNC.  Currently (2.6.31), Linux implements only  O_SYNC,  but  glibc  maps  O_DSYNC  and
       O_RSYNC  to  the  same  numerical  value as O_SYNC.  Most Linux file systems don't actually implement the
       POSIX O_SYNC semantics, which require all metadata updates of a write to be on disk on returning to  user
       space,  but  only  the  O_DSYNC  semantics, which require only actual file data and metadata necessary to
       retrieve it to be on disk by the time the system call returns.

       Note that open() can open device special files, but creat() cannot create them; use mknod(2) instead.

       On NFS file systems with UID mapping enabled, open() may return  a  file  descriptor  but,  for  example,
       read(2) requests are denied with EACCES.  This is because the client performs open() by checking the per‐
       missions, but UID mapping is performed by the server upon read and write requests.

       If the file is newly created, its st_atime, st_ctime, st_mtime fields (respectively, time of last access,
       time  of last status change, and time of last modification; see stat(2)) are set to the current time, and
       so are the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the parent directory.  Otherwise,  if  the  file  is  modified
       because of the O_TRUNC flag, its st_ctime and st_mtime fields are set to the current time.

   O_DIRECT
       The  O_DIRECT  flag may impose alignment restrictions on the length and address of user-space buffers and
       the file offset of I/Os.  In Linux alignment restrictions vary by file  system  and  kernel  version  and
       might  be absent entirely.  However there is currently no file system-independent interface for an appli‐
       cation to discover these restrictions for a given file or file system.  Some file systems  provide  their
       own interfaces for doing so, for example the XFS_IOC_DIOINFO operation in xfsctl(3).

       Under  Linux  2.4,  transfer  sizes, and the alignment of the user buffer and the file offset must all be
       multiples of the logical block size of the file system.  Under Linux 2.6, alignment  to  512-byte  bound‐
       aries suffices.

       O_DIRECT  I/Os  should  never be run concurrently with the fork(2) system call, if the memory buffer is a
       private mapping (i.e., any mapping created with the mmap(2) MAP_PRIVATE flag; this includes memory  allo‐
       cated  on  the heap and statically allocated buffers).  Any such I/Os, whether submitted via an asynchro‐
       nous I/O interface or from another thread in the process, should be completed before fork(2)  is  called.
       Failure  to  do  so  can  result in data corruption and undefined behavior in parent and child processes.
       This restriction does not apply when the memory buffer for the O_DIRECT I/Os was created  using  shmat(2)
       or  mmap(2)  with  the  MAP_SHARED flag.  Nor does this restriction apply when the memory buffer has been
       advised as MADV_DONTFORK with madvise(2), ensuring that it will not  be  available  to  the  child  after
       fork(2).

       The  O_DIRECT  flag  was  introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment restrictions similar to those of
       Linux 2.4.  IRIX has also a fcntl(2) call to query appropriate alignments, and sizes.  FreeBSD 4.x intro‐
       duced a flag of the same name, but without alignment restrictions.

       O_DIRECT  support was added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10.  Older Linux kernels simply ignore this
       flag.  Some file systems may not implement the flag and open() will fail with EINVAL if it is used.

       Applications should avoid mixing O_DIRECT and normal I/O to the same file, and especially to  overlapping
       byte  regions in the same file.  Even when the file system correctly handles the coherency issues in this
       situation, overall I/O throughput is likely to be slower than using either mode alone.  Likewise,  appli‐
       cations should avoid mixing mmap(2) of files with direct I/O to the same files.

       The  behaviour  of O_DIRECT with NFS will differ from local file systems.  Older kernels, or kernels con‐
       figured in certain ways, may not support this combination.  The NFS protocol does not support passing the
       flag  to  the server, so O_DIRECT I/O will bypass the page cache only on the client; the server may still
       cache the I/O.  The client asks the server to make the I/O synchronous to preserve the synchronous seman‐
       tics of O_DIRECT.  Some servers will perform poorly under these circumstances, especially if the I/O size
       is small.  Some servers may also be configured to lie to clients about  the  I/O  having  reached  stable
       storage;  this  will  avoid the performance penalty at some risk to data integrity in the event of server
       power failure.  The Linux NFS client places no alignment restrictions on O_DIRECT I/O.

       In summary, O_DIRECT is a potentially powerful tool that should be used with caution.  It is  recommended
       that applications treat use of O_DIRECT as a performance option which is disabled by default.

              "The thing that has always disturbed me about O_DIRECT is that the whole interface is just stupid,
              and was probably designed by a deranged monkey on some serious mind-controlling substances."—Linus

BUGS
       Currently, it is not possible to enable signal-driven I/O by specifying O_ASYNC when calling open();  use
       fcntl(2) to enable this flag.
