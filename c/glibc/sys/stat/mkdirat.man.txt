MKDIRAT(2)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 MKDIRAT(2)



NAME
       mkdirat - create a directory relative to a directory file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h> /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include <sys/stat.h>

       int mkdirat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       mkdirat():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _ATFILE_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  mkdirat()  system  call  operates  in  exactly  the same way as mkdir(2), except for the differences
       described in this manual page.

       If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory  referred
       to  by  the  file  descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling
       process, as is done by mkdir(2) for a relative pathname).

       If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to
       the current working directory of the calling process (like mkdir(2)).

       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, mkdirat() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The  same  errors  that occur for mkdir(2) can also occur for mkdirat().  The following additional errors
       can occur for mkdirat():

       EBADF  dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTDIR
              pathname is relative and dirfd is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.

VERSIONS
       mkdirat() was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16; library support was added to glibc in version 2.4.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for mkdirat().
