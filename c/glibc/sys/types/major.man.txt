MAKEDEV(3)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 MAKEDEV(3)



NAME
       makedev, major, minor - manage a device number

SYNOPSIS
       #define _BSD_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <sys/types.h>

       dev_t makedev(int maj, int min);

       unsigned int major(dev_t dev);
       unsigned int minor(dev_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
       A device ID consists of two parts: a major ID, identifying the class of the device, and a minor ID, iden‐
       tifying a specific instance of a device in that class.  A device ID is represented using the type dev_t.

       Given major and minor device IDs, makedev() combines these to produce a device ID, returned as the  func‐
       tion result.  This device ID can be given to mknod(2), for example.

       The  major()  and  minor()  functions  perform the converse task: given a device ID, they return, respec‐
       tively, the major and minor components.  These macros can be useful to, for example, decompose the device
       IDs in the structure returned by stat(2).

CONFORMING TO
       The makedev(), major(), and minor() functions are not specified in POSIX.1, but are present on many other
       systems.

NOTES
       These interfaces are defined as macros.  Since glibc 2.3.3, they have been aliases for three GNU-specific
       functions:  gnu_dev_makedev(),  gnu_dev_major(), and gnu_dev_minor().  The latter names are exported, but
       the traditional names are more portable.

       mknod(2), stat(2)
