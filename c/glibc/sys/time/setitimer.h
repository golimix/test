//ITIMER_REAL    decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon expiration.
//
//ITIMER_VIRTUAL decrements only when the process is executing, and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration.
//
//ITIMER_PROF    decrements both when the process executes and when the system is executing  on  behalf  of
//              the  process.  Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually used to profile the time
//              spent by the application in user and kernel space.  SIGPROF is delivered upon expiration.
