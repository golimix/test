GETITIMER(2)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                               GETITIMER(2)



NAME
       getitimer, setitimer - get or set value of an interval timer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/time.h>

       int getitimer(int which, struct itimerval *curr_value);
       int setitimer(int which, const struct itimerval *new_value,
                     struct itimerval *old_value);

DESCRIPTION
       The system provides each process with three interval timers, each decrementing in a distinct time domain.
       When any timer expires, a signal is sent to the process, and the timer (potentially) restarts.

       ITIMER_REAL    decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon expiration.

       ITIMER_VIRTUAL decrements only when the process is executing, and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration.

       ITIMER_PROF    decrements both when the process executes and when the system is executing  on  behalf  of
                      the  process.  Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually used to profile the time
                      spent by the application in user and kernel space.  SIGPROF is delivered upon expiration.

       Timer values are defined by the following structures:

           struct itimerval {
               struct timeval it_interval; /* next value */
               struct timeval it_value;    /* current value */
           };

           struct timeval {
               time_t      tv_sec;         /* seconds */
               suseconds_t tv_usec;        /* microseconds */
           };

       The function getitimer() fills the structure pointed to by curr_value with the current  setting  for  the
       timer  specified  by which (one of ITIMER_REAL, ITIMER_VIRTUAL, or ITIMER_PROF).  The element it_value is
       set to the amount of time remaining on the timer, or zero if the timer is disabled.  Similarly, it_inter‐
       val is set to the reset value.

       The  function  setitimer() sets the specified timer to the value in new_value.  If old_value is non-NULL,
       the old value of the timer is stored there.

       Timers decrement from it_value to zero, generate a signal, and reset to it_interval.  A  timer  which  is
       set to zero (it_value is zero or the timer expires and it_interval is zero) stops.

       Both tv_sec and tv_usec are significant in determining the duration of a timer.

       Timers  will  never  expire  before the requested time, but may expire some (short) time afterward, which
       depends on the system timer resolution and on the system load; see time(7).  (But see BUGS below.)   Upon
       expiration,  a  signal  will be generated and the timer reset.  If the timer expires while the process is
       active (always true for ITIMER_VIRTUAL) the signal will be delivered immediately when generated.   Other‐
       wise the delivery will be offset by a small time dependent on the system loading.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT new_value, old_value, or curr_value is not valid a pointer.

       EINVAL which  is  not  one of ITIMER_REAL, ITIMER_VIRTUAL, or ITIMER_PROF; or (since Linux 2.6.22) one of
              the tv_usec fields in the structure pointed to by new_value contains a value outside the  range  0
              to 999999.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001,  SVr4,  4.4BSD  (this  call  first appeared in 4.2BSD).  POSIX.1-2008 marks getitimer() and
       setitimer() obsolete, recommending the use of the POSIX timers API  (timer_gettime(2),  timer_settime(2),
       etc.) instead.

NOTES
       A child created via fork(2) does not inherit its parent's interval timers.  Interval timers are preserved
       across an execve(2).

       POSIX.1 leaves the interaction between setitimer() and  the  three  interfaces  alarm(2),  sleep(3),  and
       usleep(3) unspecified.

       The standards are silent on the meaning of the call:

           setitimer(which, NULL, &old_value);

       Many systems (Solaris, the BSDs, and perhaps others) treat this as equivalent to:

           getitimer(which, &old_value);

       In  Linux, this is treated as being equivalent to a call in which the new_value fields are zero; that is,
       the timer is disabled.  Don't use this Linux misfeature: it is nonportable and unnecessary.

BUGS
       The generation and delivery of a signal are distinct, and only one instance of each of the signals listed
       above may be pending for a process.  Under very heavy loading, an ITIMER_REAL timer may expire before the
       signal from a previous expiration has been delivered.  The second signal in such an event will be lost.

       On Linux kernels before 2.6.16, timer values are represented in jiffies.  If a  request  is  made  set  a
       timer   with   a   value   whose   jiffies   representation   exceeds   MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES   (defined  in
       include/linux/jiffies.h), then the timer is silently truncated to  this  ceiling  value.   On  Linux/i386
       (where,  since Linux 2.6.13, the default jiffy is 0.004 seconds), this means that the ceiling value for a
       timer is approximately 99.42 days.  Since Linux 2.6.16, the kernel uses a different internal  representa‐
       tion for times, and this ceiling is removed.

       On  certain  systems  (including i386), Linux kernels before version 2.6.12 have a bug which will produce
       premature timer expirations of up to one jiffy under some circumstances.  This bug  is  fixed  in  kernel
       2.6.12.

       POSIX.1-2001  says  that  setitimer()  should fail if a tv_usec value is specified that is outside of the
       range 0 to 999999.  However, in kernels up to and including 2.6.21, Linux does not  give  an  error,  but
       instead  silently adjusts the corresponding seconds value for the timer.  From kernel 2.6.22 onward, this
       nonconformance has been repaired: an improper tv_usec value results in an EINVAL error.
