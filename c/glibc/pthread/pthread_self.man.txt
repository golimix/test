PTHREAD_SELF(3)                             Linux Programmer's Manual                            PTHREAD_SELF(3)



NAME
       pthread_self - obtain ID of the calling thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       pthread_t pthread_self(void);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_self()  function  returns  the  ID  of  the  calling thread.  This is the same value that is
       returned in *thread in the pthread_create(3) call that created this thread.

RETURN VALUE
       This function always succeeds, returning the calling thread's ID.

ERRORS
       This function always succeeds.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       POSIX.1 allows an implementation wide freedom in choosing the type used to represent  a  thread  ID;  for
       example,  representation  using  either an arithmetic type or a structure is permitted.  Therefore, vari‐
       ables  of  type  pthread_t  can't  portably  be  compared  using  the  C  equality  operator  (==);   use
       pthread_equal(3) instead.

       Thread  identifiers  should  be  considered opaque: any attempt to use a thread ID other than in pthreads
       calls is nonportable and can lead to unspecified results.

       Thread IDs are guaranteed to be unique only within a process.  A thread ID may be reused after  a  termi‐
       nated thread has been joined, or a detached thread has terminated.

       The thread ID returned by pthread_self() is not the same thing as the kernel thread ID returned by a call
       to gettid(2).
