PTHREAD_EQUAL(3)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                           PTHREAD_EQUAL(3)



NAME
       pthread_equal - compare thread IDs

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_equal(pthread_t t1, pthread_t t2);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_equal() function compares two thread identifiers.

RETURN VALUE
       If the two thread IDs are equal, pthread_equal() returns a nonzero value; otherwise, it returns 0.

ERRORS
       This function always succeeds.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  pthread_equal()  function  is  necessary because thread IDs should be considered opaque: there is no
       portable way for applications to directly compare two pthread_t values.
