PTHREAD_SETCONCURRENCY(3)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  PTHREAD_SETCONCURRENCY(3)



NAME
       pthread_setconcurrency, pthread_getconcurrency - set/get the concurrency level

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_setconcurrency(int new_level);
       int pthread_getconcurrency(void);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_setconcurrency() function informs the implementation of the application's desired concurrency
       level, specified in new_level.  The implementation takes this only as a hint: POSIX.1  does  not  specify
       the level of concurrency that should be provided as a result of calling pthread_setconcurrency().

       Specifying new_level as 0 instructs the implementation to manage the concurrency level as it deems appro‐
       priate.

       pthread_getconcurrency() returns the current value of the concurrency level for this process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_setconcurrency() returns 0; on error, it returns a nonzero error number.

       pthread_getconcurrency() always succeeds, returning the concurrency level  set  by  a  previous  call  to
       pthread_setconcurrency(), or 0, if pthread_setconcurrency() has not previously been called.

ERRORS
       pthread_setconcurrency() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL new_level is negative.

       POSIX.1-2001  also  documents  an  EAGAIN  error  ("the value specified by new_level would cause a system
       resource to be exceeded").

VERSIONS
       These functions are available in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The default concurrency level is 0.

       Concurrency levels are meaningful only for M:N threading implementations, where at any moment a subset of
       a  process's  set  of  user-level threads may be bound to a smaller number of kernel-scheduling entities.
       Setting the concurrency level allows the application to give the system a hint as to the number  of  ker‐
       nel-scheduling entities that should be provided for efficient execution of the application.

       Both  LinuxThreads  and  NPTL  are 1:1 threading implementations, so setting the concurrency level has no
       meaning.  In other words, on Linux these functions merely exist for compatibility with other systems, and
       they have no effect on the execution of a program.
