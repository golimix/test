SCHED_GET_PRIORITY_MAX(2)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  SCHED_GET_PRIORITY_MAX(2)



NAME
       sched_get_priority_max, sched_get_priority_min  - get static priority range

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_get_priority_max(int policy);

       int sched_get_priority_min(int policy);

DESCRIPTION
       sched_get_priority_max()  returns  the  maximum priority value that can be used with the scheduling algo‐
       rithm identified by policy.  sched_get_priority_min() returns the minimum priority value that can be used
       with  the  scheduling  algorithm identified by policy.  Supported policy values are SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR,
       SCHED_OTHER, and SCHED_BATCH.  Further details about these  policies  can  be  found  in  sched_setsched‐
       uler(2).

       Processes  with  numerically higher priority values are scheduled before processes with numerically lower
       priority values.  Thus, the value returned by sched_get_priority_max() will be  greater  than  the  value
       returned by sched_get_priority_min().

       Linux  allows  the static priority value range 1 to 99 for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR and the priority 0 for
       SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_BATCH.  Scheduling priority ranges for the various policies are not alterable.

       The range of scheduling priorities may vary on other POSIX systems, thus it is a good idea  for  portable
       applications to use a virtual priority range and map it to the interval given by sched_get_priority_max()
       and sched_get_priority_min().  POSIX.1-2001 requires a spread of at least 32 between the maximum and  the
       minimum values for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR.

       POSIX  systems  on  which  sched_get_priority_max()  and  sched_get_priority_min()  are  available define
       _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in <unistd.h>.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_get_priority_max() and sched_get_priority_min()  return  the  maximum/minimum  priority
       value for the named scheduling policy.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The argument policy does not identify a defined scheduling policy.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.
