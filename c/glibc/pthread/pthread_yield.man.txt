PTHREAD_YIELD(3)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                           PTHREAD_YIELD(3)



NAME
       pthread_yield - yield the processor

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_yield(void);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       pthread_yield()  causes the calling thread to relinquish the CPU.  The thread is placed at the end of the
       run queue for its static priority and another thread is scheduled  to  run.   For  further  details,  see
       sched_yield(2)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_yield() returns 0; on error, it returns an error number.

ERRORS
       On  Linux, this call always succeeds (but portable and future-proof applications should nevertheless han‐
       dle a possible error return).

CONFORMING TO
       This call is nonstandard, but present on several other  systems.   Use  the  standardized  sched_yield(2)
       instead.

NOTES
       On Linux, this function is implemented as a call to sched_yield(2).
