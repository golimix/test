GETPWENT(3)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                GETPWENT(3)



NAME
       getpwent, setpwent, endpwent - get password file entry

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <pwd.h>

       struct passwd *getpwent(void);

       void setpwent(void);

       void endpwent(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getpwent(), setpwent(), endpwent():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The  getpwent()  function  returns  a pointer to a structure containing the broken-out fields of a record
       from the password database (e.g., the local password file /etc/passwd, NIS, and LDAP).   The  first  time
       getpwent() is called, it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns successive entries.

       The setpwent() function rewinds to the beginning of the password database.

       The endpwent() function is used to close the password database after all processing has been performed.

       The passwd structure is defined in <pwd.h> as follows:

           struct passwd {
               char   *pw_name;       /* username */
               char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
               uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
               gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
               char   *pw_gecos;      /* user information */
               char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
               char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
           };

       For more information about the fields of this structure, see passwd(5).

RETURN VALUE
       The  getpwent() function returns a pointer to a passwd structure, or NULL if there are no more entries or
       an error occurs.  If an error occurs, errno is set appropriately.  If one wants to check errno after  the
       call, it should be set to zero before the call.

       The  return  value  may point to a static area, and may be overwritten by subsequent calls to getpwent(),
       getpwnam(3), or getpwuid(3).  (Do not pass the returned pointer to free(3).)

ERRORS
       EINTR  A signal was caught.

       EIO    I/O error.

       EMFILE The maximum number (OPEN_MAX) of files was open already in the calling process.

       ENFILE The maximum number of files was open already in the system.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to allocate passwd structure.

       ERANGE Insufficient buffer space supplied.

FILES
       /etc/passwd
              local password database file

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The getpwent() function is not thread-safe.

       The setpwent() and endpwent() functions are thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  The pw_gecos field is not specified in POSIX, but is present on most  imple‐
       mentations.
