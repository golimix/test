PTSNAME(3)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 PTSNAME(3)



NAME
       ptsname, ptsname_r - get the name of the slave pseudoterminal

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *ptsname(int fd);

       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int ptsname_r(int fd, char *buf, size_t buflen);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ptsname()  function  returns the name of the slave pseudoterminal device corresponding to the master
       referred to by fd.

       The ptsname_r() function is the reentrant equivalent of ptsname().  It returns  the  name  of  the  slave
       pseudoterminal  device  as a null-terminated string in the buffer pointed to by buf.  The buflen argument
       specifies the number of bytes available in buf.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, ptsname() returns a pointer to a string in static storage which will be overwritten by subse‐
       quent calls.  This pointer must not be freed.  On failure, a NULL pointer is returned.

       On  success, ptsname_r() returns 0.  On failure, a nonzero value is returned and errno is set to indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL (ptsname_r() only) buf is NULL.

       ENOTTY fd does not refer to a pseudoterminal master device.

       ERANGE (ptsname_r() only) buf is too small.

VERSIONS
       ptsname() is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

ATTRIBUTES
   Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The ptsname() function is not thread-safe.

       The ptsname_r() function is thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO
       ptsname() is part of the UNIX 98 pseudoterminal support (see pts(4)).   This  function  is  specified  in
       POSIX.1-2001.

       ptsname_r()  is  a  Linux extension.  A version of this function is documented on Tru64 and HP-UX, but on
       those implementations, -1 is returned on error, with errno set to indicate the error.  Avoid  using  this
       function in portable programs.
