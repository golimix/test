GRANTPT(3)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 GRANTPT(3)



NAME
       grantpt - grant access to the slave pseudoterminal
       //允许接入slave伪终端

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int grantpt(int fd);

DESCRIPTION
       The grantpt() function changes the mode and owner of the slave pseudoterminal device corresponding to the
       master pseudoterminal referred to by fd.  The user ID of the slave is set to the real UID of the  calling
       process.   The group ID is set to an unspecified value (e.g., tty).  The mode of the slave is set to 0620
       (crw--w----).

       The behavior of grantpt() is unspecified if a signal handler is installed to catch SIGCHLD signals.

RETURN VALUE
       When successful, grantpt() returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns -1 and sets errno appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES The corresponding slave pseudoterminal could not be accessed.

       EBADF  The fd argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       EINVAL The fd argument is valid but not associated with a master pseudoterminal.

VERSIONS
       grantpt() is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       This is part of the UNIX 98 pseudoterminal support, see pts(4).  Many systems implement this function via
       a set-user-ID helper binary called "pt_chown".  With Linux devpts no such helper binary is required.
