MALLOC_TRIM(3)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             MALLOC_TRIM(3)



NAME
       malloc_trim - release free memory from the top of the heap

SYNOPSIS
       #include <malloc.h>

       void malloc_trim(size_t pad);

DESCRIPTION
       The  malloc_trim()  function  attempts  to release free memory at the top of the heap (by calling sbrk(2)
       with a suitable argument).

       The pad argument specifies the amount of free space to leave untrimmed at the top of the heap.   If  this
       argument  is 0, only the minimum amount of memory is maintained at the top of the heap (i.e., one page or
       less).  A nonzero argument can be used to maintain some trailing space at the top of the heap in order to
       allow future allocations to be made without having to extend the heap with sbrk(2).

RETURN VALUE
       The  malloc_trim()  function returns 1 if memory was actually released back to the system, or 0 if it was
       not possible to release any memory.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       This function is automatically called  by  free(3)  in  certain  circumstances;  see  the  discussion  of
       M_TOP_PAD and M_TRIM_THRESHOLD in mallopt(3).

       This function cannot release free memory located at places other than the top of the heap.

       This function releases only memory in the main arena.
