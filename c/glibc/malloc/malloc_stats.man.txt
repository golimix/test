NAME
       malloc_stats - print memory allocation statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include <malloc.h>

       void malloc_stats(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The malloc_stats() function prints (on standard error) statistics about memory allocated by malloc(3) and
       related functions.  For each arena (allocation area), this function prints the  total  amount  of  memory
       allocated  and the total number of bytes consumed by in-use allocations.  (These two values correspond to
       the arena and uordblks fields retrieved by mallinfo(3).)  In addition, the function  prints  the  sum  of
       these two statistics for all arenas, and the maximum number of blocks and bytes that were ever simultane‐
       ously allocated using mmap(2).

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       More detailed information about memory allocations in the main arena can be obtained using mallinfo(3).
