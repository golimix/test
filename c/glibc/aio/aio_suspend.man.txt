AIO_SUSPEND(3)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             AIO_SUSPEND(3)



NAME
       aio_suspend - wait for asynchronous I/O operation or timeout

SYNOPSIS
       #include <aio.h>

       int aio_suspend(const struct aiocb * const aiocb_list[],
                       int nitems, const struct timespec *timeout);

       Link with -lrt.

DESCRIPTION
       The aio_suspend() function suspends the calling thread until one of the following occurs:

       *  One or more of the asynchronous I/O requests in the list aiocb_list has completed.

       *  A signal is delivered.

       *  timeout  is  not NULL and the specified time interval has passed.  (For details of the timespec struc‐
          ture, see nanosleep(2).)

       The nitems argument specifies the number of items in aiocb_list.  Each item in the  list  pointed  to  by
       aiocb_list  must  be  either NULL (and then is ignored), or a pointer to a control block on which I/O was
       initiated using aio_read(3), aio_write(3), or lio_listio(3).  (See aio(7) for a description of the  aiocb
       structure.)

       If  CLOCK_MONOTONIC  is  supported,  this  clock  is used to measure the timeout interval (see clock_get‐
       time(3)).

RETURN VALUE
       If this function returns after completion of one of the  I/O  requests  specified  in  aiocb_list,  0  is
       returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The call timed out before any of the indicated operations had completed.

       EINTR  The  call  was  ended  by  signal (possibly the completion signal of one of the operations we were
              waiting for); see signal(7).

       ENOSYS aio_suspend() is not implemented.

VERSIONS
       The aio_suspend() function is available since glibc 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       One can achieve polling by using a non-NULL timeout that specifies a zero time interval.

       If one or more of the asynchronous I/O operations specified in aiocb_list has already  completed  at  the
       time of the call to aio_suspend(), then the call returns immediately.

       To  determine  which  I/O  operations  have  completed  after a successful return from aio_suspend(), use
       aio_error(3) to scan the list of aiocb structures pointed to by aiocb_list.
