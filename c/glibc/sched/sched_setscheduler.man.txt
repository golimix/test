SCHED_SETSCHEDULER(2)                       Linux Programmer's Manual                      SCHED_SETSCHEDULER(2)



NAME
       sched_setscheduler, sched_getscheduler - set and get scheduling policy/parameters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_setscheduler(pid_t pid, int policy,
                              const struct sched_param *param);

       int sched_getscheduler(pid_t pid);

       struct sched_param {
           ...
           int sched_priority;
           ...
       };

DESCRIPTION
       sched_setscheduler()  sets both the scheduling policy and the associated parameters for the process whose
       ID is specified in pid.  If pid equals zero, the scheduling policy and parameters of the calling  process
       will  be set.  The interpretation of the argument param depends on the selected policy.  Currently, Linux
       supports the following "normal" (i.e., non-real-time) scheduling policies:

       SCHED_OTHER   the standard round-robin time-sharing policy;

       SCHED_BATCH   for "batch" style execution of processes; and

       SCHED_IDLE    for running very low priority background jobs.

       The following "real-time" policies are also supported, for special time-critical applications  that  need
       precise control over the way in which runnable processes are selected for execution:

       SCHED_FIFO    a first-in, first-out policy; and

       SCHED_RR      a round-robin policy.

       The semantics of each of these policies are detailed below.

       sched_getscheduler()  queries  the  scheduling policy currently applied to the process identified by pid.
       If pid equals zero, the policy of the calling process will be retrieved.

   Scheduling policies
       The scheduler is the kernel component that decides which runnable process will be  executed  by  the  CPU
       next.  Each process has an associated scheduling policy and a static scheduling priority, sched_priority;
       these are the settings that are modified by sched_setscheduler().  The scheduler makes it decisions based
       on knowledge of the scheduling policy and static priority of all processes on the system.

       For   processes  scheduled  under  one  of  the  normal  scheduling  policies  (SCHED_OTHER,  SCHED_IDLE,
       SCHED_BATCH), sched_priority is not used in scheduling decisions (it must be specified as 0).

       Processes scheduled under one of the real-time policies  (SCHED_FIFO,  SCHED_RR)  have  a  sched_priority
       value  in  the range 1 (low) to 99 (high).  (As the numbers imply, real-time processes always have higher
       priority than normal processes.)  Note well: POSIX.1-2001 requires an implementation to  support  only  a
       minimum  32  distinct priority levels for the real-time policies, and some systems supply just this mini‐
       mum.  Portable programs should use sched_get_priority_min(2) and sched_get_priority_max(2)  to  find  the
       range of priorities supported for a particular policy.

       Conceptually,  the  scheduler  maintains  a  list  of runnable processes for each possible sched_priority
       value.  In order to determine which process runs next, the scheduler looks for the nonempty list with the
       highest static priority and selects the process at the head of this list.

       A  process's scheduling policy determines where it will be inserted into the list of processes with equal
       static priority and how it will move inside this list.

       All scheduling is preemptive: if a process with a higher static priority becomes ready to run,  the  cur‐
       rently  running  process  will  be preempted and returned to the wait list for its static priority level.
       The scheduling policy determines the ordering only within the  list  of  runnable  processes  with  equal
       static priority.

   SCHED_FIFO: First in-first out scheduling
       SCHED_FIFO can be used only with static priorities higher than 0, which means that when a SCHED_FIFO pro‐
       cesses  becomes  runnable,  it  will  always  immediately  preempt  any  currently  running  SCHED_OTHER,
       SCHED_BATCH,  or  SCHED_IDLE  process.  SCHED_FIFO is a simple scheduling algorithm without time slicing.
       For processes scheduled under the SCHED_FIFO policy, the following rules apply:

       *  A SCHED_FIFO process that has been preempted by another process of higher priority will  stay  at  the
          head  of the list for its priority and will resume execution as soon as all processes of higher prior‐
          ity are blocked again.

       *  When a SCHED_FIFO process becomes runnable, it will be inserted at the end of the list for its  prior‐
          ity.

       *  A  call  to  sched_setscheduler()  or  sched_setparam(2) will put the SCHED_FIFO (or SCHED_RR) process
          identified by pid at the start of the list if it was runnable.  As a consequence, it may  preempt  the
          currently  running  process  if  it  has  the same priority.  (POSIX.1-2001 specifies that the process
          should go to the end of the list.)

       *  A process calling sched_yield(2) will be put at the end of the list.

       No other events will move a process scheduled under the SCHED_FIFO policy in the wait  list  of  runnable
       processes with equal static priority.

       A  SCHED_FIFO process runs until either it is blocked by an I/O request, it is preempted by a higher pri‐
       ority process, or it calls sched_yield(2).

   SCHED_RR: Round-robin scheduling
       SCHED_RR is a simple enhancement of SCHED_FIFO.  Everything described above for SCHED_FIFO  also  applies
       to  SCHED_RR,  except that each process is allowed to run only for a maximum time quantum.  If a SCHED_RR
       process has been running for a time period equal to or longer than the time quantum, it will  be  put  at
       the  end  of  the list for its priority.  A SCHED_RR process that has been preempted by a higher priority
       process and subsequently resumes execution as a running process will complete the  unexpired  portion  of
       its  round-robin time quantum.  The length of the time quantum can be retrieved using sched_rr_get_inter‐
       val(2).

   SCHED_OTHER: Default Linux time-sharing scheduling
       SCHED_OTHER can be used at only static priority 0.  SCHED_OTHER is the standard Linux time-sharing sched‐
       uler  that  is  intended  for  all  processes  that do not require the special real-time mechanisms.  The
       process to run is chosen from the static priority 0 list based on a dynamic priority that  is  determined
       only  inside  this  list.   The  dynamic priority is based on the nice value (set by nice(2) or setprior‐
       ity(2)) and increased for each time quantum the process is ready to run, but denied to run by the  sched‐
       uler.  This ensures fair progress among all SCHED_OTHER processes.

   SCHED_BATCH: Scheduling batch processes
       (Since  Linux  2.6.16.)   SCHED_BATCH  can  be used only at static priority 0.  This policy is similar to
       SCHED_OTHER in that it schedules the process according to its dynamic priority (based on the nice value).
       The  difference  is  that  this policy will cause the scheduler to always assume that the process is CPU-
       intensive.  Consequently, the scheduler will apply a small scheduling penalty with respect to wakeup  be‐
       haviour, so that this process is mildly disfavored in scheduling decisions.

       This  policy  is useful for workloads that are noninteractive, but do not want to lower their nice value,
       and for workloads that want a deterministic scheduling policy without interactivity causing extra preemp‐
       tions (between the workload's tasks).

   SCHED_IDLE: Scheduling very low priority jobs
       (Since  Linux  2.6.23.)   SCHED_IDLE can be used only at static priority 0; the process nice value has no
       influence for this policy.

       This policy is intended for running jobs at extremely low priority (lower even than a +19 nice value with
       the SCHED_OTHER or SCHED_BATCH policies).

   Resetting scheduling policy for child processes
       Since Linux 2.6.32, the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag can be ORed in policy when calling sched_setscheduler().
       As a result of including this flag, children created by fork(2)  do  not  inherit  privileged  scheduling
       policies.   This feature is intended for media-playback applications, and can be used to prevent applica‐
       tions evading the RLIMIT_RTTIME resource limit (see getrlimit(2)) by creating multiple child processes.

       More precisely, if the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag is specified, the following rules apply for  subsequently
       created children:

       *  If  the  calling  process  has  a  scheduling policy of SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, the policy is reset to
          SCHED_OTHER in child processes.

       *  If the calling process has a negative nice value, the nice value is reset to zero in child processes.

       After the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag has been enabled, it  can  be  reset  only  if  the  process  has  the
       CAP_SYS_NICE capability.  This flag is disabled in child processes created by fork(2).

       The SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag is visible in the policy value returned by sched_getscheduler()

   Privileges and resource limits
       In  Linux kernels before 2.6.12, only privileged (CAP_SYS_NICE) processes can set a nonzero static prior‐
       ity (i.e., set a real-time scheduling policy).  The only change that an unprivileged process can make  is
       to  set  the  SCHED_OTHER  policy,  and  this  can be done only if the effective user ID of the caller of
       sched_setscheduler() matches the real or effective user ID of the target process (i.e., the process spec‐
       ified by pid) whose policy is being changed.

       Since  Linux  2.6.12,  the  RLIMIT_RTPRIO  resource  limit defines a ceiling on an unprivileged process's
       static priority for the SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO policies.  The rules for changing scheduling  policy  and
       priority are as follows:

       *  If  an  unprivileged process has a nonzero RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit, then it can change its scheduling
          policy and priority, subject to the restriction that the priority cannot be set to a value higher than
          the maximum of its current priority and its RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit.

       *  If the RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit is 0, then the only permitted changes are to lower the priority, or to
          switch to a non-real-time policy.

       *  Subject to the same rules, another unprivileged process can also make these changes, as  long  as  the
          effective user ID of the process making the change matches the real or effective user ID of the target
          process.

       *  Special rules apply for the SCHED_IDLE.  In Linux kernels before 2.6.39, an unprivileged process oper‐
          ating  under  this  policy  cannot  change  its  policy,  regardless of the value of its RLIMIT_RTPRIO
          resource limit.  In Linux kernels since 2.6.39, an unprivileged  process  can  switch  to  either  the
          SCHED_BATCH  or  the SCHED_NORMAL policy so long as its nice value falls within the range permitted by
          its RLIMIT_NICE resource limit (see getrlimit(2)).

       Privileged (CAP_SYS_NICE) processes ignore the RLIMIT_RTPRIO limit; as with older kernels, they can  make
       arbitrary  changes  to  scheduling  policy  and  priority.   See  getrlimit(2) for further information on
       RLIMIT_RTPRIO.

   Response time
       A blocked high priority process waiting for the I/O has a certain response time before  it  is  scheduled
       again.  The device driver writer can greatly reduce this response time by using a "slow interrupt" inter‐
       rupt handler.

   Miscellaneous
       Child processes inherit the scheduling policy and parameters across a fork(2).  The scheduling policy and
       parameters are preserved across execve(2).

       Memory  locking  is  usually needed for real-time processes to avoid paging delays; this can be done with
       mlock(2) or mlockall(2).

       Since a nonblocking infinite loop in a process scheduled under SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR will block all pro‐
       cesses  with  lower  priority forever, a software developer should always keep available on the console a
       shell scheduled under a higher static priority than the tested application.  This will allow an emergency
       kill  of tested real-time applications that do not block or terminate as expected.  See also the descrip‐
       tion of the RLIMIT_RTTIME resource limit in getrlimit(2).

       POSIX systems on which sched_setscheduler() and sched_getscheduler() are available  define  _POSIX_PRIOR‐
       ITY_SCHEDULING in <unistd.h>.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  sched_setscheduler() returns zero.  On success, sched_getscheduler() returns the policy for
       the process (a nonnegative integer).  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The scheduling policy is not one of the recognized policies, param is NULL, or param does not make
              sense for the policy.

       EPERM  The calling process does not have appropriate privileges.

       ESRCH  The process whose ID is pid could not be found.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001 (but see BUGS below).  The SCHED_BATCH and SCHED_IDLE policies are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       POSIX.1  does  not  detail  the  permissions  that  an  unprivileged  process  requires  in order to call
       sched_setscheduler(), and details vary across systems.  For example, the Solaris 7 manual page says  that
       the  real or effective user ID of the calling process must match the real user ID or the save set-user-ID
       of the target process.

       The scheduling policy and parameters are in fact per-thread attributes on Linux.  The value returned from
       a call to gettid(2) can be passed in the argument pid.  Specifying pid as 0 will operate on the attribute
       for the calling thread, and passing the value returned from a call  to  getpid(2)  will  operate  on  the
       attribute  for  the  main  thread of the thread group.  (If you are using the POSIX threads API, then use
       pthread_setschedparam(3),  pthread_getschedparam(3),  and   pthread_setschedprio(3),   instead   of   the
       sched_*(2) system calls.)

       Originally,  Standard Linux was intended as a general-purpose operating system being able to handle back‐
       ground processes, interactive applications, and less demanding real-time applications (applications  that
       need  to usually meet timing deadlines).  Although the Linux kernel 2.6 allowed for kernel preemption and
       the newly introduced O(1) scheduler ensures that the time needed to schedule is fixed  and  deterministic
       irrespective  of  the number of active tasks, true real-time computing was not possible up to kernel ver‐
       sion 2.6.17.

   Real-time features in the mainline Linux kernel
       From kernel version 2.6.18 onward, however, Linux is gradually becoming equipped with real-time capabili‐
       ties, most of which are derived from the former realtime-preempt patches developed by Ingo Molnar, Thomas
       Gleixner, Steven Rostedt, and others.  Until the patches have been completely merged  into  the  mainline
       kernel  (this is expected to be around kernel version 2.6.30), they must be installed to achieve the best
       real-time performance.  These patches are named:

           patch-kernelversion-rtpatchversion

       and can be downloaded from ⟨http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/⟩.

       Without the patches and prior to their full inclusion into the mainline kernel, the kernel  configuration
       offers  only  the three preemption classes CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE, CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY, and CONFIG_PRE‐
       EMPT_DESKTOP which respectively provide no, some, and considerable reduction of the worst-case scheduling
       latency.

       With  the patches applied or after their full inclusion into the mainline kernel, the additional configu‐
       ration item CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT becomes available.  If this is selected, Linux is transformed into a  regu‐
       lar  real-time  operating  system.   The  FIFO  and  RR  scheduling  policies  that can be selected using
       sched_setscheduler() are then used to run a process with true real-time priority and a minimum worst-case
       scheduling latency.

BUGS
       POSIX  says  that  on  success, sched_setscheduler() should return the previous scheduling policy.  Linux
       sched_setscheduler() does not conform to this requirement, since it always returns 0 on success.
