SETNS(2)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   SETNS(2)



NAME
       setns - reassociate thread with a namespace

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <sched.h>

       int setns(int fd, int nstype);

DESCRIPTION
       Given a file descriptor referring to a namespace, reassociate the calling thread with that namespace.

       The  fd  argument  is  a  file  descriptor referring to one of the namespace entries in a /proc/[pid]/ns/
       directory; see proc(5) for further information on /proc/[pid]/ns/.  The calling thread will be  reassoci‐
       ated with the corresponding namespace, subject to any constraints imposed by the nstype argument.

       The  nstype argument specifies which type of namespace the calling thread may be reassociated with.  This
       argument can have one of the following values:

       0      Allow any type of namespace to be joined.

       CLONE_NEWIPC
              fd must refer to an IPC namespace.

       CLONE_NEWNET
              fd must refer to a network namespace.

       CLONE_NEWUTS
              fd must refer to a UTS namespace.

       Specifying nstype as 0 suffices if the caller knows (or does not care) what type of namespace is referred
       to  by  fd.   Specifying  a  nonzero  value for nstype is useful if the caller does not know what type of
       namespace is referred to by fd and wants to ensure that the namespace is  of  a  particular  type.   (The
       caller  might  not  know the type of the namespace referred to by fd if the file descriptor was opened by
       another process and, for example, passed to the caller via a UNIX domain socket.)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, setns() returns 0.  On failure, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL fd refers to a namespace whose type does not match that specified in nstype, or there  is  problem
              with reassociating the the thread with the specified namespace.

       ENOMEM Cannot allocate sufficient memory to change the specified namespace.

       EPERM  The calling thread did not have the required privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) for this operation.

VERSIONS
       The setns() system call first appeared in Linux in kernel 3.0; library support was added to glibc in ver‐
       sion 2.14.

CONFORMING TO
       The setns() system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Not all of the attributes that can be shared when a new thread is created using clone(2) can  be  changed
       using setns().

EXAMPLE
       The  program below takes two or more arguments.  The first argument specifies the pathname of a namespace
       file in an existing /proc/[pid]/ns/ directory.  The remaining arguments specify a command and  its  argu‐
       ments.  The program opens the namespace file, joins that namespace using setns(), and executes the speci‐
       fied command inside that namespace.

       The following shell session demonstrates the use of this program (compiled as a binary named ns_exec)  in
       conjunction  with  the  CLONE_NEWUTS example program in the clone(2) man page (complied as a binary named
       newuts).

       We begin by executing the example program in clone(2) in the background.  That program creates a child in
       a  separate UTS namespace.  The child changes the hostname in its namespace, and then both processes dis‐
       play the hostnames in their UTS namespaces, so that we can see that they are different.

           $ su                   # Need privilege for namespace operations
           Password:
           # ./newuts bizarro &
           [1] 3549
           clone() returned 3550
           uts.nodename in child:  bizarro
           uts.nodename in parent: antero
           # uname -n             # Verify hostname in the shell
           antero

       We then run the program shown below, using it to execute a shell.  Inside that shell, we verify that  the
       hostname is the one set by the child created by the first program:

           # ./ns_exec /proc/3550/ns/uts /bin/bash
           # uname -n             # Executed in shell started by ns_exec
           bizarro

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           int fd;

           if (argc < 3) {
               fprintf(stderr, "%s /proc/PID/ns/FILE cmd args...\n", argv[0]);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);   /* Get descriptor for namespace */
           if (fd == -1)
               errExit("open");

           if (setns(fd, 0) == -1)         /* Join that namespace */
               errExit("setns");

           execvp(argv[2], &argv[2]);      /* Execute a command in namespace */
           errExit("execvp");
       }
