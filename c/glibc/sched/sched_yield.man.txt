SCHED_YIELD(2)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             SCHED_YIELD(2)



NAME
       sched_yield - yield the processor
					放弃CPU： 该接口导致调用的线程放弃CPU，
					这个线程被移动到优先级队列的队尾，另一个线程将被运行
SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_yield(void);

DESCRIPTION
       sched_yield()  causes  the  calling  thread to relinquish the CPU.  The thread is moved to the end of the
       queue for its static priority and a new thread gets to run.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_yield() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       In the Linux implementation, sched_yield() always succeeds.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       If the calling thread is the only thread in the highest priority list at that time, it will  continue  to
       run after a call to sched_yield().

       POSIX systems on which sched_yield() is available define _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in <unistd.h>.

       Strategic calls to sched_yield() can improve performance by giving other threads or processes a chance to
       run when (heavily) contended resources (e.g., mutexes) have been released by the caller.   Avoid  calling
       sched_yield()  unnecessarily or inappropriately (e.g., when resources needed by other schedulable threads
       are still held by the caller), since doing so will result in unnecessary  context  switches,  which  will
       degrade system performance.
