FNMATCH(3)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 FNMATCH(3)



NAME
       fnmatch - match filename or pathname

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fnmatch.h>

       int fnmatch(const char *pattern, const char *string, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fnmatch() function checks whether the string argument matches the pattern argument, which is a shell
       wildcard pattern.

       The flags argument modifies the behavior; it is the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following flags:

       FNM_NOESCAPE
              If this flag is set, treat backslash as an ordinary character, instead of an escape character.

       FNM_PATHNAME
              If this flag is set, match a slash in string only with a slash in pattern and not by  an  asterisk
              (*) or a question mark (?) metacharacter, nor by a bracket expression ([]) containing a slash.

       FNM_PERIOD
              If  this flag is set, a leading period in string has to be matched exactly by a period in pattern.
              A period is considered to be leading if it is the first character in string, or if both  FNM_PATH‐
              NAME is set and the period immediately follows a slash.

       FNM_FILE_NAME
              This is a GNU synonym for FNM_PATHNAME.

       FNM_LEADING_DIR
              If  this  flag  (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is considered to be matched if it matches an
              initial segment of string which is followed by a slash.  This flag is mainly for the internal  use
              of glibc and is implemented only in certain cases.

       FNM_CASEFOLD
              If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is matched case-insensitively.

RETURN VALUE
       Zero  if string matches pattern, FNM_NOMATCH if there is no match or another nonzero value if there is an
       error.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.2.  The FNM_FILE_NAME, FNM_LEADING_DIR, and FNM_CASEFOLD flags are GNU extensions.
