PRCTL(2)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   PRCTL(2)



NAME
       prctl - operations on a process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/prctl.h>

       int prctl(int option, unsigned long arg2, unsigned long arg3,
                 unsigned long arg4, unsigned long arg5);

DESCRIPTION
       prctl()  is  called with a first argument describing what to do (with values defined in <linux/prctl.h>),
       and further arguments with a significance depending on the first one.  The first argument can be:

       PR_CAPBSET_READ (since Linux 2.6.25)
              Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified in arg2 is in the  calling  thread's
              capability bounding set, or 0 if it is not.  (The capability constants are defined in <linux/capa‐
              bility.h>.)  The capability bounding set dictates whether the process can receive  the  capability
              through a file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to execve(2).

              If the capability specified in arg2 is not valid, then the call fails with the error EINVAL.

       PR_CAPBSET_DROP (since Linux 2.6.25)
              If  the  calling thread has the CAP_SETPCAP capability, then drop the capability specified by arg2
              from the calling thread's capability bounding set.   Any  children  of  the  calling  thread  will
              inherit the newly reduced bounding set.

              The  call  fails with the error: EPERM if the calling thread does not have the CAP_SETPCAP; EINVAL
              if arg2 does not represent a valid capability; or EINVAL if file capabilities are not  enabled  in
              the kernel, in which case bounding sets are not supported.

       PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER (since Linux 3.4)
              If  arg2  is nonzero, set the "child subreaper" attribute of the calling process; if arg2 is zero,
              unset the attribute.  When a process is marked as a child subreaper, all of the children  that  it
              creates, and their descendants, will be marked as having a subreaper.  In effect, a subreaper ful‐
              fills the role of init(1) for its descendant processes.  Upon termination of  a  process  that  is
              orphaned (i.e., its immediate parent has already terminated) and marked as having a subreaper, the
              nearest still living ancestor subreaper will receive a SIGCHLD signal and be able  to  wait(2)  on
              the process to discover its termination status.

       PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER (since Linux 3.4)
              Return the "child subreaper" setting of the caller, in the location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 2.3.20)
              Set the state of the flag determining whether core dumps are produced for the calling process upon
              delivery of a signal whose default behavior is to produce a core dump.  (Normally,  this  flag  is
              set for a process by default, but it is cleared when a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is exe‐
              cuted and also by various system calls that manipulate process UIDs and GIDs).  In kernels  up  to
              and  including 2.6.12, arg2 must be either 0 (process is not dumpable) or 1 (process is dumpable).
              Between kernels 2.6.13 and 2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted, which caused any  binary  which
              normally  would  not be dumped to be dumped readable by root only; for security reasons, this fea‐
              ture has been removed.  (See also the description of /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable in proc(5).)  Pro‐
              cesses that are not dumpable can not be attached via ptrace(2) PTRACE_ATTACH.

       PR_GET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 2.3.20)
              Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling process's dumpable flag.

       PR_SET_ENDIAN (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)
              Set  the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given in arg2, which should be one of the
              following:  PR_ENDIAN_BIG,  PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE,  or  PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE  (PowerPC  pseudo   little
              endian).

       PR_GET_ENDIAN (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)
              Return the endian-ness of the calling process, in the location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_FPEMU (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)
              Set  floating-point  emulation control bits to arg2.  Pass PR_FPEMU_NOPRINT to silently emulate fp
              operations accesses, or PR_FPEMU_SIGFPE to not emulate fp operations and send SIGFPE instead.

       PR_GET_FPEMU (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)
              Return floating-point emulation control bits, in the location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_FPEXC (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)
              Set floating-point exception mode to arg2.  Pass PR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE to use FPEXC for FP exception
              enables,  PR_FP_EXC_DIV  for floating-point divide by zero, PR_FP_EXC_OVF for floating-point over‐
              flow, PR_FP_EXC_UND for floating-point underflow, PR_FP_EXC_RES for floating-point inexact result,
              PR_FP_EXC_INV for floating-point invalid operation, PR_FP_EXC_DISABLED for FP exceptions disabled,
              PR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV for async nonrecoverable exception mode, PR_FP_EXC_ASYNC for async  recoverable
              exception mode, PR_FP_EXC_PRECISE for precise exception mode.

       PR_GET_FPEXC (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)
              Return floating-point exception mode, in the location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_KEEPCAPS (since Linux 2.2.18)
              Set  the  state  of  the thread's "keep capabilities" flag, which determines whether the threads's
              permitted capability set is cleared when a change is made to the threads's user IDs such that  the
              threads's  real  UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID all become nonzero when at least one of
              them previously had the value 0.  By default, the permitted capability set is cleared when such  a
              change is made; setting the "keep capabilities" flag prevents it from being cleared.  arg2 must be
              either 0 (permitted capabilities are cleared) or 1 (permitted capabilities are kept).  (A thread's
              effective  capability  set  is always cleared when such a credential change is made, regardless of
              the setting of the "keep capabilities" flag.)  The "keep capabilities" value will be reset to 0 on
              subsequent calls to execve(2).

       PR_GET_KEEPCAPS (since Linux 2.2.18)
              Return  (as  the  function  result) the current state of the calling threads's "keep capabilities"
              flag.

       PR_SET_NAME (since Linux 2.6.9)
              Set the name of the calling thread, using the value in the location pointed to by  (char *)  arg2.
              The  name  can  be  up to 16 bytes long, and should be null-terminated if it contains fewer bytes.
              This is the same  attribute  that  can  be  set  via  pthread_setname_np(3)  and  retrieved  using
              pthread_getname_np(3).  The attribute is likewise accessible via /proc/self/task/[tid]/comm, where
              tid is the name of the calling thread.

       PR_GET_NAME (since Linux 2.6.11)
              Return the name of the calling thread, in the buffer pointed to  by  (char *)  arg2.   The  buffer
              should  allow  space  for  up  to  16  bytes; the returned string will be null-terminated if it is
              shorter than that.

       PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS (since Linux 3.5)
              Set the calling process's no_new_privs bit to the value in arg2.   With  no_new_privs  set  to  1,
              execve(2)  promises  not  to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done without
              the execve(2) call (for example, rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission  bits,  and
              file  capabilities  non-functional).  Once set, this bit cannot be unset.  The setting of this bit
              is inherited by children created by fork(2) and clone(2), and preserved across execve(2).

              For more information, see the kernel source file Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt.

       PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS (since Linux 3.5)
              Return the value of the no_new_privs bit for the current process.  A value of 0 indicates the reg‐
              ular execve(2) behavior.  A value of 1 indicates execve(2) will operate in the privilege-restrict‐
              ing mode described above.

       PR_SET_PDEATHSIG (since Linux 2.1.57)
              Set the parent process death signal of the calling process to arg2 (either a signal value  in  the
              range  1..maxsig,  or  0 to clear).  This is the signal that the calling process will get when its
              parent dies.  This value is cleared for the child of a fork(2) and (since Linux 2.4.36  /  2.6.23)
              when executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID binary.

       PR_GET_PDEATHSIG (since Linux 2.3.15)
              Return the current value of the parent process death signal, in the location pointed to by (int *)
              arg2.

       PR_SET_PTRACER (since Linux 3.4)
              This is meaningful only when the Yama LSM is enabled and in mode 1 ("restricted  ptrace",  visible
              via /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope).  When a "ptracer process ID" is passed in arg2, the call‐
              er is declaring that the ptracer process can ptrace(2) the calling process as if it were a  direct
              process  ancestor.   Each  PR_SET_PTRACER  operation  replaces  the previous "ptracer process ID".
              Employing PR_SET_PTRACER with arg2 set to 0 clears the caller's "ptracer process ID".  If arg2  is
              PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY,  the  ptrace  restrictions introduced by Yama are effectively disabled for the
              calling process.

              For further information, see the kernel source file Documentation/security/Yama.txt.

       PR_SET_SECCOMP (since Linux 2.6.23)
              Set the secure computing (seccomp) mode for the calling thread,  to  limit  the  available  system
              calls.   The seccomp mode is selected via arg2.  (The seccomp constants are defined in <linux/sec‐
              comp.h>.)

              With arg2 set to SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT the only system calls that the thread is  permitted  to  make
              are read(2), write(2), _exit(2), and sigreturn(2).  Other system calls result in the delivery of a
              SIGKILL signal.  Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching applications that may
              need  to  execute  untrusted  byte  code, perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.  This
              operation is available only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.

              With arg2 set to SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER (since Linux 3.5) the system calls allowed are defined  by  a
              pointer  to  a  Berkeley  Packet  Filter  passed  in  arg3.   This argument is a pointer to struct
              sock_fprog; it can be designed to filter arbitrary system calls and system call  arguments.   This
              mode is available only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER enabled.

              If SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER filters permit fork(2), then the seccomp mode is inherited by children cre‐
              ated by fork(2); if execve(2) is permitted, then the seccomp mode is preserved  across  execve(2).
              If  the  filters permit prctl() calls, then additional filters can be added; they are run in order
              until the first non-allow result is seen.

              For further information, see the kernel source file Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt.

       PR_GET_SECCOMP (since Linux 2.6.23)
              Return the secure computing mode of the calling thread.  If the caller is not in secure  computing
              mode, this operation returns 0; if the caller is in strict secure computing mode, then the prctl()
              call will cause a SIGKILL signal to be sent to the process.  If the caller is in filter mode,  and
              this  system  call  is  allowed by the seccomp filters, it returns 2.  This operation is available
              only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.

       PR_SET_SECUREBITS (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Set the "securebits" flags of the calling thread to the value supplied  in  arg2.   See  capabili‐
              ties(7).

       PR_GET_SECUREBITS (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Return  (as  the  function  result)  the  "securebits" flags of the calling thread.  See capabili‐
              ties(7).

       PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS (since Linux 3.5)
              Retrieve   the   clear_child_tid   address   set   by   set_tid_address(2)   and   the    clone(2)
              CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID flag, in the location pointed to by (int **) arg2.  This feature is available
              only if the kernel is built with the CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE option enabled.

       PR_SET_TIMERSLACK (since Linux 2.6.28)
              Set the current timer slack for the calling thread to the nanosecond value supplied in  arg2.   If
              arg2  is  less  than or equal to zero, reset the current timer slack to the thread's default timer
              slack value.  The timer slack is used by the kernel to group timer  expirations  for  the  calling
              thread that are close to one another; as a consequence, timer expirations for the thread may be up
              to the specified number of nanoseconds late (but will never expire early).  Grouping timer expira‐
              tions can help reduce system power consumption by minimizing CPU wake-ups.

              The  timer  expirations  affected  by timer slack are those set by select(2), pselect(2), poll(2),
              ppoll(2), epoll_wait(2), epoll_pwait(2), clock_nanosleep(2), nanosleep(2), and futex(2) (and  thus
              the    library   functions   implemented   via   futexes,   including   pthread_cond_timedwait(3),
              pthread_mutex_timedlock(3),  pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock(3),   pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(3),   and
              sem_timedwait(3)).

              Timer  slack  is not applied to threads that are scheduled under a realtime scheduling policy (see
              sched_setscheduler(2)).

              Each thread has two associated timer slack values: a "default" value, and a "current" value.   The
              current  value  is  the one that governs grouping of timer expirations.  When a new thread is cre‐
              ated, the two timer slack values are made the same as the current value of  the  creating  thread.
              Thereafter,  a  thread can adjust its current timer slack value via PR_SET_TIMERSLACK (the default
              value can't be changed).  The timer slack values of init (PID 1), the ancestor of  all  processes,
              are 50,000 nanoseconds (50 microseconds).  The timer slack values are preserved across execve(2).

       PR_GET_TIMERSLACK (since Linux 2.6.28)
              Return the current timer slack value of the calling thread.

       PR_SET_TIMING (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)
              Set  whether  to  use (normal, traditional) statistical process timing or accurate timestamp-based
              process timing, by passing PR_TIMING_STATISTICAL or PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP to arg2.   PR_TIMING_TIME‐
              STAMP is not currently implemented (attempting to set this mode will yield the error EINVAL).

       PR_GET_TIMING (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)
              Return (as the function result) which process timing method is currently in use.

       PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE (since Linux 2.6.31)
              Disable  all performance counters attached to the calling process, regardless of whether the coun‐
              ters were created by this process or another process.  Performance counters created by the calling
              process for other processes are unaffected.  For more information on performance counters, see the
              Linux kernel source file tools/perf/design.txt.

              Originally called PR_TASK_PERF_COUNTERS_DISABLE; renamed (with  same  numerical  value)  in  Linux
              2.6.32.

       PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_ENABLE (since Linux 2.6.31)
              The  converse  of PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE; enable performance counters attached to the calling
              process.

              Originally called PR_TASK_PERF_COUNTERS_ENABLE; renamed in Linux 2.6.32.

       PR_SET_TSC (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)
              Set the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter can be read  by  the  process.
              Pass  PR_TSC_ENABLE  to  arg2 to allow it to be read, or PR_TSC_SIGSEGV to generate a SIGSEGV when
              the process tries to read the timestamp counter.

       PR_GET_TSC (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)
              Return the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter can be read, in  the  loca‐
              tion pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_UNALIGN
              (Only  on:  ia64,  since  Linux  2.3.48;  parisc, since Linux 2.6.15; PowerPC, since Linux 2.6.18;
              Alpha, since Linux 2.6.22) Set unaligned access control bits to arg2.  Pass PR_UNALIGN_NOPRINT  to
              silently fix up unaligned user accesses, or PR_UNALIGN_SIGBUS to generate SIGBUS on unaligned user
              access.

       PR_GET_UNALIGN
              (see PR_SET_UNALIGN for information on versions and architectures) Return unaligned access control
              bits, in the location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_MCE_KILL (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Set  the  machine  check  memory  corruption  kill  policy  for  the  current  thread.  If arg2 is
              PR_MCE_KILL_CLEAR, clear the thread memory corruption kill policy and use the system-wide default.
              (The  system-wide  default is defined by /proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill; see proc(5).)  If
              arg2 is PR_MCE_KILL_SET, use a thread-specific memory corruption kill policy.  In this case,  arg3
              defines whether the policy is early kill (PR_MCE_KILL_EARLY), late kill (PR_MCE_KILL_LATE), or the
              system-wide default (PR_MCE_KILL_DEFAULT).  Early kill means that the  thread  receives  a  SIGBUS
              signal  as  soon as hardware memory corruption is detected inside its address space.  In late kill
              mode, the process is killed only when it accesses a corrupted page.   See  sigaction(2)  for  more
              information  on  the  SIGBUS  signal.   The policy is inherited by children.  The remaining unused
              prctl() arguments must be zero for future compatibility.

       PR_MCE_KILL_GET (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Return the current per-process machine check kill policy.  All unused prctl()  arguments  must  be
              zero.

       PR_SET_MM (since Linux 3.3)
              Modify  certain  kernel memory map descriptor fields of the calling process.  Usually these fields
              are set by the kernel and dynamic loader (see ld.so(8) for more information) and a regular  appli‐
              cation  should  not  use this feature.  However, there are cases, such as self-modifying programs,
              where a program might find it useful to change its own memory map.  This feature is available only
              if  the  kernel  is  built with the CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE option enabled.  The calling process
              must have the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability.  The value in arg2 is one of the options  below,  while
              arg3 provides a new value for the option.

              PR_SET_MM_START_CODE
                     Set  the  address above which the program text can run.  The corresponding memory area must
                     be readable and executable, but not writable or sharable (see mprotect(2) and  mmap(2)  for
                     more information).

              PR_SET_MM_END_CODE
                     Set  the  address below which the program text can run.  The corresponding memory area must
                     be readable and executable, but not writable or sharable.

              PR_SET_MM_START_DATA
                     Set the address above which initialized and uninitialized (bss) data are placed.  The  cor‐
                     responding memory area must be readable and writable, but not executable or sharable.

              PR_SET_MM_END_DATA
                     Set  the address below which initialized and uninitialized (bss) data are placed.  The cor‐
                     responding memory area must be readable and writable, but not executable or sharable.

              PR_SET_MM_START_STACK
                     Set the start address of the stack.  The corresponding memory area  must  be  readable  and
                     writable.

              PR_SET_MM_START_BRK
                     Set the address above which the program heap can be expanded with brk(2) call.  The address
                     must be greater than the ending address of the current program data segment.  In  addition,
                     the  combined  size of the resulting heap and the size of the data segment can't exceed the
                     RLIMIT_DATA resource limit (see setrlimit(2)).

              PR_SET_MM_BRK
                     Set the current brk(2) value.  The requirements for the address are the  same  as  for  the
                     PR_SET_MM_START_BRK option.

RETURN VALUE
       On   success,  PR_GET_DUMPABLE,  PR_GET_KEEPCAPS,  PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS,  PR_CAPBSET_READ,  PR_GET_TIMING,
       PR_GET_SECUREBITS, PR_MCE_KILL_GET, and (if it returns)  PR_GET_SECCOMP  return  the  nonnegative  values
       described  above.   All  other option values return 0 on success.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT arg2 is an invalid address.

       EINVAL The value of option is not recognized.

       EINVAL option is PR_MCE_KILL or PR_MCE_KILL_GET or PR_SET_MM, and unused prctl() arguments were not spec‐
              ified as zero.

       EINVAL arg2 is not valid value for this option.

       EINVAL option is PR_SET_SECCOMP or PR_GET_SECCOMP, and the kernel was not configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP.

       EINVAL option is PR_SET_MM, and one of the following is true

              *  arg4 or arg5 is nonzero;

              *  arg3 is greater than TASK_SIZE (the limit on the size of the user address space for this archi‐
                 tecture);

              *  arg2 is PR_SET_MM_START_CODE, PR_SET_MM_END_CODE, PR_SET_MM_START_DATA, PR_SET_MM_END_DATA,  or
                 PR_SET_MM_START_STACK,  and  the  permissions  of  the  corresponding  memory  area  are not as
                 required;

              *  arg2 is PR_SET_MM_START_BRK or PR_SET_MM_BRK, and arg3 is less than or equal to the end of  the
                 data  segment  or  specifies  a  value  that  would  cause the RLIMIT_DATA resource limit to be
                 exceeded.

       EINVAL option is PR_SET_PTRACER and arg2 is not 0, PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY, or the PID of an existing process.

       EPERM  option is PR_SET_SECUREBITS, and the caller does not have the CAP_SETPCAP capability, or tried  to
              unset  a  "locked" flag, or tried to set a flag whose corresponding locked flag was set (see capa‐
              bilities(7)).

       EPERM  option is PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, and the callers's SECURE_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED flag is  set  (see  capabili‐
              ties(7)).

       EPERM  option is PR_CAPBSET_DROP, and the caller does not have the CAP_SETPCAP capability.

       EPERM  option is PR_SET_MM, and the caller does not have the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability.

VERSIONS
       The prctl() system call was introduced in Linux 2.1.57.

CONFORMING TO
       This  call  is  Linux-specific.   IRIX  has  a  prctl()  system  call (also introduced in Linux 2.1.44 as
       irix_prctl on the MIPS architecture), with prototype

       ptrdiff_t prctl(int option, int arg2, int arg3);

       and options to get the maximum number of processes per user, get the maximum  number  of  processors  the
       calling  process can use, find out whether a specified process is currently blocked, get or set the maxi‐
       mum stack size, and so on.
