MQ_OPEN(3)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 MQ_OPEN(3)



NAME
       mq_open - open a message queue

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h>           /* For O_* constants */
       #include <sys/stat.h>        /* For mode constants */
       #include <mqueue.h>

       mqd_t mq_open(const char *name, int oflag);
       mqd_t mq_open(const char *name, int oflag, mode_t mode,
                     struct mq_attr *attr);

       Link with -lrt.

DESCRIPTION
       mq_open() creates a new POSIX message queue or opens an existing queue.  The queue is identified by name.
       For details of the construction of name, see mq_overview(7).

       The oflag argument specifies flags that control the operation of the call.   (Definitions  of  the  flags
       values can be obtained by including <fcntl.h>.)  Exactly one of the following must be specified in oflag:

       O_RDONLY
              Open the queue to receive messages only.

       O_WRONLY
              Open the queue to send messages only.

       O_RDWR Open the queue to both send and receive messages.

       Zero or more of the following flags can additionally be ORed in oflag:

       O_NONBLOCK
              Open  the  queue  in  nonblocking mode.  In circumstances where mq_receive(3) and mq_send(3) would
              normally block, these functions instead fail with the error EAGAIN.

       O_CREAT
              Create the message queue if it does not exist.  The owner (user ID) of the message queue is set to
              the effective user ID of the calling process.  The group ownership (group ID) is set to the effec‐
              tive group ID of the calling process.

       O_EXCL If O_CREAT was specified in oflag, and a queue with the given name already exists, then fail  with
              the error EEXIST.

       If  O_CREAT  is  specified  in  oflag, then two additional arguments must be supplied.  The mode argument
       specifies the permissions to be placed on the new queue, as for open(2).  (Symbolic definitions  for  the
       permissions bits can be obtained by including <sys/stat.h>.)  The permissions settings are masked against
       the process umask.  The attr argument specifies attributes for the queue.  See mq_getattr(3) for details.
       If attr is NULL, then the queue is created with implementation-defined default attributes.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  mq_open()  returns a message queue descriptor for use by other message queue functions.  On
       error, mq_open() returns (mqd_t) -1, with errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The queue exists, but the caller does not have permission to open it in the specified mode.

       EACCES name contained more than one slash.

       EEXIST Both O_CREAT and O_EXCL were specified in oflag, but a queue with this name already exists.

       EINVAL O_CREAT was specified in oflag, and attr was not NULL, but attr->mq_maxmsg or attr->mq_msqsize was
              invalid.  Both of these fields must be greater than zero.  In a process that is unprivileged (does
              not have the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability), attr->mq_maxmsg must be  less  than  or  equal  to  the
              msg_max limit, and attr->mq_msgsize must be less than or equal to the msgsize_max limit.  In addi‐
              tion, even in a privileged process,  attr->mq_maxmsg  cannot  exceed  the  HARD_MAX  limit.   (See
              mq_overview(7) for details of these limits.)

       EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of files and message queues open.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              name was too long.

       ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open files and message queues has been reached.

       ENOENT The O_CREAT flag was not specified in oflag, and no queue with this name exists.

       ENOENT name was just "/" followed by no other characters.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory.

       ENOSPC Insufficient  space  for  the creation of a new message queue.  This probably occurred because the
              queues_max limit was encountered; see mq_overview(7).

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

BUGS
       In kernels before 2.6.14, the process umask was not applied to the permissions specified in mode.
