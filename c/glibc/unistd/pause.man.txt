NAME
       pause - wait for signal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int pause(void);

DESCRIPTION
       pause()  causes  the  calling process (or thread) to sleep until a signal is delivered that either termi‐
       nates the process or causes the invocation of a signal-catching function.

RETURN VALUE
       pause() returns only when a signal was caught and the signal-catching function returned.   In  this  case
       pause() returns -1, and errno is set to EINTR.

ERRORS
       EINTR  a signal was caught and the signal-catching function returned.
