SYNC(2)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    SYNC(2)



NAME
       sync, syncfs - commit buffer cache to disk

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       void sync(void);

       int syncfs(int fd);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sync():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

       syncfs():
           _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       sync()  causes  all buffered modifications to file metadata and data to be written to the underlying file
       systems.

       syncfs() is like sync(), but synchronizes just the file system containing file referred to  by  the  open
       file descriptor fd.

RETURN VALUE
       syncfs() returns 0 on success; on error, it returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       sync() is always successful.

       syncfs() can fail for at least the following reason:

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

VERSIONS
       syncfs() first appeared in Linux 2.6.39; library support was added to glibc in version 2.14.

CONFORMING TO
       sync(): SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

       syncfs() is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Since glibc 2.2.2 the Linux prototype for sync() is as listed above, following the various standards.  In
       libc4, libc5, and glibc up to 2.2.1 it was "int sync(void)", and sync() always returned 0.

BUGS
       According to the standard specification (e.g., POSIX.1-2001), sync() schedules the writes, but may return
       before  the actual writing is done.  However, since version 1.3.20 Linux does actually wait.  (This still
       does not guarantee data integrity: modern disks have large caches.)
