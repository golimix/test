SYMLINKAT(2)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                               SYMLINKAT(2)



NAME
       symlinkat - create a symbolic link relative to a directory file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h> /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include <unistd.h>

       int symlinkat(const char *oldpath, int newdirfd, const char *newpath);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       symlinkat():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _ATFILE_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  symlinkat()  system  call operates in exactly the same way as symlink(2), except for the differences
       described in this manual page.

       If the pathname given in newpath is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the  directory  referred
       to  by the file descriptor newdirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling
       process, as is done by symlink(2) for a relative pathname).

       If newpath is relative and newdirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then newpath is  interpreted  relative
       to the current working directory of the calling process (like symlink(2)).

       If newpath is absolute, then newdirfd is ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, symlinkat() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The  same  errors  that  occur  for  symlink(2) can also occur for symlinkat().  The following additional
       errors can occur for symlinkat():

       EBADF  newdirfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTDIR
              newpath is relative and newdirfd is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.

VERSIONS
       symlinkat() was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16; library support was added to glibc in version 2.4.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for symlinkat().
