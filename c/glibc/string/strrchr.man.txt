STRCHR(3)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  STRCHR(3)



NAME
       strchr, strrchr, strchrnul - locate character in string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strchr(const char *s, int c);

       char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);

       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <string.h>

       char *strchrnul(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
       The strchr() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s.

       The strrchr() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character c in the string s.

       The  strchrnul()  function is like strchr() except that if c is not found in s, then it returns a pointer
       to the null byte at the end of s, rather than NULL.

       Here "character" means "byte"; these functions do not work with wide or multibyte characters.

RETURN VALUE
       The strchr() and strrchr() functions return a pointer to the matched character or NULL if  the  character
       is  not  found.  The terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if c is specified as
       '\0', these functions return a pointer to the terminator.

       The strchrnul() function returns a pointer to the matched character, or a pointer to the null byte at the
       end of s (i.e., s+strlen(s)) if the character is not found.

VERSIONS
       strchrnul() first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.1.

CONFORMING TO
       strchr() and strrchr() are in SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.  strchrnul() is a GNU extension.
