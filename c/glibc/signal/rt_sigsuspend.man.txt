SIGSUSPEND(2)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              SIGSUSPEND(2)



NAME
       sigsuspend - wait for a signal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sigsuspend(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       sigsuspend()  temporarily replaces the signal mask of the calling process with the mask given by mask and
       then suspends the process until delivery of a signal whose action is to invoke a  signal  handler  or  to
       terminate a process.

       If  the  signal terminates the process, then sigsuspend() does not return.  If the signal is caught, then
       sigsuspend() returns after the signal handler returns, and the signal  mask  is  restored  to  the  state
       before the call to sigsuspend().

       It  is  not  possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP; specifying these signals in mask, has no effect on the
       process's signal mask.

RETURN VALUE
       sigsuspend() always returns -1, with errno set to inndicate the error (normally, EINTR).

ERRORS
       EFAULT mask points to memory which is not a valid part of the process address space.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Normally, sigsuspend() is used in conjunction with sigprocmask(2) in order to prevent delivery of a  sig‐
       nal  during  the execution of a critical code section.  The caller first blocks the signals with sigproc‐
       mask(2).  When the critical code has completed, the caller then waits for the signals by calling  sigsus‐
       pend() with the signal mask that was returned by sigprocmask(2) (in the oldset argument).

       See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating signal sets.
