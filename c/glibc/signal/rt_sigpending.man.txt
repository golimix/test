SIGPENDING(2)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              SIGPENDING(2)



NAME
       sigpending - examine pending signals

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int sigpending(sigset_t *set);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sigpending(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       sigpending()  returns  the  set of signals that are pending for delivery to the calling thread (i.e., the
       signals which have been raised while blocked).  The mask of pending signals is returned in set.

RETURN VALUE
       sigpending() returns 0 on success and -1 on error.  In the event of an error, errno is  set  to  indicate
       the cause.

ERRORS
       EFAULT set points to memory which is not a valid part of the process address space.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating signal sets.

       The  set  of  signals that is pending for a thread is the union of the set of signals that is pending for
       that thread and the set of signals that is pending for the process as a whole; see signal(7).

       A child created via fork(2) initially has an empty pending signal set; the pending  signal  set  is  pre‐
       served across an execve(2).

BUGS
       In  versions  of glibc up to and including 2.2.1, there is a bug in the wrapper function for sigpending()
       which means that information about pending real-time signals is not correctly returned.
