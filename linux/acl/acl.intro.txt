acl - access control lists

## acl in /etc/fstab

File systems that support access control lists, or acls, have to be mounted with the acl
option listed in /etc/fstab. In the example below, you can see that the root file system has
acl support, whereas /home/data does not.

root@laika:~# tail -4 /etc/fstab
/dev/sda1 / ext3 acl,relatime 0 1
/dev/sdb2 /home/data auto noacl,defaults 0 0
pasha:/home/r /home/pasha nfs defaults 0 0
wolf:/srv/data /home/wolf nfs defaults 0 0
